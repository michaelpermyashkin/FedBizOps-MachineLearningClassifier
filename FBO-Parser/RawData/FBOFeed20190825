<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br /><br /><br />The Government requires the purchase of the following plug and play Frequency Resolved Optical Grating (FROG) based Pulse Analyzer to measure pulse widths of an ultra-short pulse laser:
<p>Product code: IQFROG-1.5Micron-LiNbO3-FA<br />Description: <br />Frequency Resolved Optical Grating (FROG) based Optical Pulse Analyzer; <br />Center wavelength: 1550 nm; <br />Input Wavelength range: 1520nm - 1610nm;<br />Input spectral FWHM: 0.2nm - 10nm; <br />Input Pulse FWHM: 0.3ps - 10ps (transform limited) or up to 50 ps (Chirped);<br />Intensity &amp; phase measurement for pulses 300 fs to 50 ps long;<br />Autocorrelation measurement up to 50 ps;<br />Temporal Resolution: 15 fs<br />Fiber coupled input <br />Optical connectors: FC/APC.<br />Quantity: 1</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>Coherent Solutions Ltd <br />Unit A, 28 Canaveral Drive<br />David McCormick: d.mccormick@coherentsolutions.com</p>
<p><br />The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. It is essential to obtain this pulse analyzer due to the unique capability to measure a broad range of laser pulse widths with fiber coupled input. The broad pulse width range of this system allows for better laser diagnostic as well as experiment capabilities in the lab. The fiber coupled design of this system makes it a plug and play system for optical pulse analysis. This system built by Coherent solutions will integrate with existing ultra-short pulse laser systems in the lab. No other known source produces a fiber coupled system with the desired center wavelength and pulse width measurement range. If this system is not purchased it would lead to duplication of cost, due to a need for multiple systems to extend the pulse width measurement range.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quote, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date&nbsp; before 30 September 2019.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.270-304 ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

EVALUATION PROCESS: 
The Government intends to award one or more Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation that provides the best benefit to the Government, price and other factors considered. Proposals will be evaluated by performing a comparative evaluation in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3) to determine which response represents the best as a whole. 
Proposals will be evaluated by performing a direct comparison of one offer with another in a uniform manner to determine which proposal provides the government with its needs, as identified in the RFQ. The government reserves the right to consider a response that offers more than the minimum and select that response if it provides a benefit to the government. The government has the discretion to accept other than the lowest priced offeror that provides additional benefits. The government also has the has the discretion to make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best benefit to the government.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  
SDVOSB/VOSB Status in CVE at time solicitation closed
Pricing: The sum of all the CLINs will represent the total evaluated price. Proposed price must be determined to be fair and reasonable to be eligible for award in terms of reasonableness and realism.

Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. 

Comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for like items. 

Use of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry. 

Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements. 

Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. 

Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items. 

Analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. 

Because below-cost prices are not inherently improper, when vendors are competing for award of a fixed-price contract, vendors are given notice that a business decision to submit a low-priced quotation may be considered as reflecting on their understanding of the contract requirements or the risk associated with their approach.

Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing exits when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items for the base and or option years is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
Technical Acceptability.  Each offeror s technical quotations will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides acceptable delivery time, product, safety plan, safety record and added value if required.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
