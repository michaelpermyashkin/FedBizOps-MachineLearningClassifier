The target Training Audience (TA) for this capability is the commander and their staff. As the Army's constructive simulation product suite, JLCCTC supports the institutional and operational unit training, for both active component, National Guard and reserve component units, providing the capabilities needed to support the Full Range of Military Operations. These operations include Offensive, Defensive, and Stability/Civil Support. The U.S. Government's determination is the anticipated JLCCTC contract shall be competed under Full and Open Competition.</p>\r\n<p>This is a DRAFT Solicitation and serves as a mechanism for comments and recommendations from industry to be submitted regarding the PEO STRI JLCCTC requirement. The intent of this DRAFT Solicitation is to allow an exchange with industry in the form of questions, comments, suggestions, and corrections regarding perceived unnecessary or inefficient requirements. Potential Offerors should not rely upon the Draft RFP in developing their final proposed approach, because the final RFP is likely to differ from the draft. Potential Offerors are encouraged to comment on all aspects of the DRAFT Solicitation and identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements for the JLCCTC effort that may significantly improve the final solicitation.</p>\r\n<p>A Pre-Solicitation Conference is tentatively set for the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2019.
