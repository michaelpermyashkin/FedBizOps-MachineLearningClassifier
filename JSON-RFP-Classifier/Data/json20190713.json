FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) are dependent upon information technologies for almost everything they do, yet more needs to be done to secure the processing foundations upon which information technology infrastructure depends. Additionally, the sheer volume of data types being continuously being collected is now so voluminous that only a small subset of the data collected can effectively be refined into information, knowledge and actionable intelligence for decision makers.</p>\r\n<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white papers under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research, development, integration, test and evaluation of innovative technologies/techniques that establish trusted foundations for hardware and software that enable secure, resilient, affordable Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence and Cyber (C4+1I) information processing systems. Additional innovative technologies are sought to simultaneously increase the computational sophistication and decision aid capacities of these same systems.</p>\r\n<p>Of particular interest are technologies that support hardware and software foundations for high assurance, trusted/secure architectures, increased computational sophistication of general purpose and specialized processing, increased complex system functionality with improved resilience and embedded processing. Also of interest are technologies that can reduce warfighter decision latencies/response time, decrease system costs and system development times, automate labor-intensive/error-prone and costly aspects of system software development, and improve reliability, longevity, upgradability, and usability of emerging and legacy military information systems.</p>\r\n<p>Operation in a contested cyberspace domain requires that our systems must be resilient to unforeseen cyber-attacks. System characteristics dependent on geo-distribution, autonomy, and cooperation rely on trust within the system. Many mission critical systems and components currently lack the ability to adapt and be resilient to unforeseen failure and cyber-attacks. Methodologies and techniques to understand, maintain or reestablish trust in the system and its components to ensure mission success during execution and fight-through are non-existent. Resilient systems must possess self-healing capabilities that can dynamically effect change in the system to fight through unforeseen cyber-attacks (while maintaining mission essential functions (MEF)) as well as provide proof of continued or re-established trust in the system, as the dynamic change will have eroded mission/system trust based on the time-consuming, human-intensive and expensive Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) established offline prior to mission deployment. To overcome these challenges, computing architectures require advances in resiliency technologies that enable fight through of unforeseen faults and cyber-attacks, while simultaneously assessing and/or reestablishing trust in near real-time to ensure mission success.</p>\r\n<p>This effort will investigate the research, development, and/or application of trusted/secure information processing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas:</p>\r\n<p>(1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems: This technical area encompasses all information processing technology, both hardware and software, that could potentially contribute to enhancing the security, trustworthiness, functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability, resiliency, upgradability, and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of conventional hardware technologies include domain-specific/specialized processing engines (both digital and analog), heterogeneous and many-core processing architectures with emphasis on hardware support for graph analytics processing, semantic operations, energy-efficient and energy-aware processing architectures, high assurance/trusted/secure processing architectures, sophisticated memory controllers and performance optimization tools.</p>\r\n<p>(2) Trusted and Resilient Software-intensive Systems Engineering: The objective of the trusted and resilient software-intensive systems engineering technical area is to develop techniques, methodologies and tools to guarantee trust (as measured by correctness, security, reliability, predictability, and survivability) and maintain this trust as self-healing/resilient techniques fight through cyber-attacks to include zero-day attacks. This research area is seeking to extend and advance software development tools that will enable the development and/or execution of trusted and resilient software systems for enterprise and tactical level embedded cyber physical platforms. This area will focus on research and development to advance SW development tools, to include formal tools, model based techniques and/or architectures based approaches to enable the development of software (SW) systems that are both trusted and resilient. Research and development will also be focused on new approaches, methods and/or tools for continuous (runtime) V&amp;V and runtime environments that can monitor and maintain a trusted and resilient envelope of operation. Technical areas of interest include: techniques to enable trust in model-based software engineering; model-based engineering for predictable software attributes; Formal methods tools; provably correct code generation; provably correct code repair, evidence-based software assurance; evolutionary approaches, trusted software and systems composability; modeling, analysis, and verification of autonomous software; novel architectural approaches, strategic \"roots of trust,\" hardening and resiliency techniques such as artificial diversity, containment areas for execution of untrusted software, lightweight runtime monitoring techniques and utilization of hardware (HW) advances, trusted and resilient mechanisms to fight through software failures, cyber-attacks to include zero-day attack; human understanding and trust of automated software development, red teaming, metrics and measures of trustworthy systems, integration, validation and demonstration on a realistic mission critical embedded system exemplar, autonomous resilience, self-healing software systems, and pliable computing.</p>\r\n<p><br />(3) Trusted, secure, and resilient computational systems: The objective of this technical area is to research and develop the essential elements, tools and methodologies for trusted, secure and resilient computing environments, including both the underlying hardware and software, side by side with power, cost, performance, and reliability. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\r\n<p>(a) Problems and challenges with current processor designs for trustworthiness and their solutions; (b) Problems and challenges with current computer architectures for trustworthiness and solutions to them; <br />(c) Tools and methodologies for ensuring trustworthiness of integrated circuits (ICs) and systems targeting malicious inclusions, side-channel attacks, probing attacks, etc.; <br />(d) New computer architectures for secure and reliable computing, including data integrity and code protection and verification; <br />(e) Operating System level constructs, objects, functions and distributions that must be provided to complement the hardware to enable a trustworthy computing base; <br />(f) State-of-the-art software-based assurance designs, methodologies or concepts which are better suited for implementation in hardware than software.</p>\r\n<p>This technical area is also interested in research and development for increasing the level of trustworthiness of IC designs, commodity ICs and currently available systems as a whole. Finally, this technical area is also interested in security enhancements possible in the software tool chain used for compiling and linking source code, runtime security as well as research in the implications of state-of-the-art commercially available processor architectures and specially designed processor architectures that will enable delivery of trustworthy, secure and timely information.</p>\r\n<p>(4) Cyber Physical Systems (CPS): The objective of this technical area is to develop the tools, methodologies, and foundational science to provide the scalability and interoperability necessary to make the integration and subsequent analysis of computational and physical components and the networks connecting them practicable. Technical areas of interest include:</p>\r\n<p>(a) Specification, modeling, and analysis such as heterogeneous models of computation and hybrid discrete and continuous systems; <br />(b) Modularity, composability, predictability, and synthesis addressing the issues of scalability and the integration of legacy systems; and <br />(c) Verification and validation techniques (assurance, simulation, formal methods, correct-and-secure-by-construction, etc.) applicable to these models.</p>\r\n<p>(5) Software Assurance: Achieving the degree of Software Assurance across the application space requires a holistic approach that agilely addresses all layers of the supply chain and enterprise including governance, partnerships, process, standards, and education. The objective of this area is to enhance and create the foundations of Software Assurance (SwA). To achieve this objective new and unique methods of conducting software assurance must be pursued. The use of machine learning in SwA analysis can enhance not only classes of tools, but should be used across all SwA activities. This can be applied as a smart SwA tool consolidation framework. The framework can then reason over the outputs of tools, then combined with previous data, or knowledge of the software under analysis, the framework can then guide other tools. This guidance should help one class of tool's strength's overcome another class of tool's weaknesses. Additional areas of interest include: Tools Assessment and Categorization; Prototype Software Assurance Demonstration; and SwA technology which advances the state of SwA by addressing technology gaps to improve SwA tools (e.g. precision and recall) and scalability (e.g. code size, expertise required, and execution time).</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>II.

ALLOWABLE CHARGES: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by 2 CFR part 200.458, Pre-Award Costs.</p>\r\n<p>e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a government approved accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</p>\r\n<p>f. HUMAN USE: All research involving human subjects, to include the use of human biological specimens and human data, selected for funding must comply with Federal regulations for human subject protection. Further, research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the DoD must comply with 32 CFR 219, \"Protection of Human Subjects\" found at: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/32cfr219_07.html, and DoD Instruction 3216.02, \"Protection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD-Supported Research\" found at: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf.</p>\r\n<p>1) Institutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for example a Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide Assurance found at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp.</p>\r\n<p>2) All institutions engaged in human subject research, to include subcontractors, must have a valid assurance. In addition, personnel involved in human subject research must document the completion of appropriate training for the protection of human subjects.</p>\r\n<p>3) For all research that will involve human subjects in the first year or phase of the project, the institution must submit evidence of a plan for review by an institutional review board (IRB) as part of the proposal. The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the institution's Assurance of Compliance. The protocol, separate from the proposal, must include a detailed description of the research plan, study population, risks and benefits of study participation, recruitment and consent process, data collection, and data analysis. The designated IRB should be consulted for guidance on writing the protocol. The informed consent document must comply with 32 CFR 219.116. A valid Assurance of Compliance and evidence of appropriate training by all investigators should accompany the protocol for review by the IRB.</p>\r\n<p>4) In addition to a local IRB approval, an AFRL-level human subject regulatory review and approval is required for all research conducted or supported by the DoD. The Air Force office responsible for managing the award can provide guidance and information about the AFRL-level review process. Confirmation of a current Assurance of Compliance and appropriate human subjects protection training is required before AFRL-level approval can be issued.</p>\r\n<p>5) The time required to complete the IRB review/approval process will vary depending on the complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants; ample time should be allotted to complete the approval process. The IRB approval process can last between 1 to 3 months, followed by a DoD review that could last 3 to 6 months. No funding may be used toward human subject research until all approvals are granted. Therefore, in their cost proposals offerors should separate human use into a separate option.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the research areas of interest and expected results within the broad topic areas as described in the Funding Opportunity section of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>\r\n<p>a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the proposed technical approach to the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology demonstrates scientific and technical merit, clearly defined and developed technical concepts and sufficient detail to support the proposed concepts and technical claims. <br />b. Capabilities and Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge to establish that the offeror has credible capability and experience to complete the proposed work. <br />c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness.<br />d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any)</p>\r\n<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>\r\n<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>\r\n<p>a. Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as \"handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks.\" These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>\r\n<p>b. WHITE PAPER/PROPOSAL REVIEW PROCESS:</p>\r\n<p>1. FIRST STEP - White Paper Reviews: The Government will review White Papers to determine which of them have the potential to best meet the Air Force's needs based on the criteria listed above. If white papers are of interest and funding is available, AFRL/RI will request a formal technical and cost proposal from offeror. If white papers are not of interest or there is not funding available, a letter is sent to the offeror indicating the reason not selected.</p>\r\n<p>2. SECOND STEP - Proposal Review and Selection Process<br />a) Categories: Based on the evaluation, proposals will be categorized as Selectable or Not Selectable (see definitions below). The selection of one or more offerors for award will be based on the evaluation, as well as importance to agency programs and funding availability.</p>\r\n<p>1. Selectable: Proposals are recommended for acceptance, if sufficient funding* is available. <br />2. Not Selectable: Even if sufficient funding existed, the proposal should not be funded.</p>\r\n<p>* Selectable proposals will be designated as funded or unfunded. Letters will be sent to the unfunded offerors. These proposals may be funded at a later date without reevaluation, if funding becomes available.</p>\r\n<p>b) The Government reserves the right to award some, all, or none of the proposals. When the Government elects to award only a part of a proposal, the selected part may be categorized as Selectable, though the proposal as a whole may not merit such a categorization.</p>\r\n<p>c. No other evaluation criteria will be used.</p>\r\n<p>d. Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk for technical, cost, and schedule will be assessed for formal proposals, should they be requested, as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Proposal risk for schedule relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>\r\n<p>e. Prior to award of a potentially successful offer, the Contracting Officer will make a determination regarding price reasonableness and realism.</p>\r\n<p>3. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: As required by 2 CFR 200 of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, the Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and FAR 9.104-6.</p>\r\n<p><strong>VI.

AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the research areas of interest and expected results within the broad topic areas as described in the Funding Opportunity section of this BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the TPOC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. All offerors submitting proposals will receive notification of their evaluation results within 45 days of submission. Offerors should email the TPOC and the Contracting Officer listed in Section VII, for status of their proposal after 45 days, if no such correspondence has been received.</p>\r\n<p>3. DEBRIEFINGS: If a debriefing is requested in accordance with the time guidelines set out in FAR 15.505 and 15.506, a debriefing will be provided, but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016). Debriefings will not be provided for white papers.</p>\r\n<p>4. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>\r\n<p>a. FACILITY CLEARANCE. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>\r\n<p>b. EXPORT CONTROL LAWS. Awards under this solicitation may require access to, or generation of, data subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at http://www.dla.mil/HQ/InformationOperations/LogisticsInformationServices.aspx or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-2255 (24/7). You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>\r\n<p>c. SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.

Non-small businesses are encouraged to team with small business concerns to come up with the best technical solutions and obtain the best mix of cost, performance and schedule.</p>\r\n<p>d. ACTIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, CONTROLLED INFORMATION, KEY PERSONNEL AND CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES. Offerors who are requested to submit a proposal under this solicitation of grants, cooperative agreements, Technology Investment Agreements, and other non-procurement transactions only shall submit specific information for all key personnel, whether or not the individuals' efforts under the project are to be funded by the DoD. Specific requirements will be detailed in the Request for Proposal (RFP) letter. The information shall be included in the Research and Related/Key Person Profile (Expanded) form (https://www.grants.gov/forms/r-r-family.html). This collection only applies to persons identified as key personnel. This information shall not be included in the overall proposal page limits. Failure to submit this information may cause the proposal to be returned without further review, and the DoD reserves the right to request further details before making a final determination on funding an effort. This information will be used to support protection of intellectual property, controlled information, key personnel, and information about critical technologies relevant to national security. Additionally, this information will be used to limit undue influence, including foreign talent programs, by countries that desire to exploit United States' technology within the DoD research, science and technology, and innovation enterprise.</p>\r\n<p>e. BURDEN REDUCTION. With the exception of paragraph d. above, in order to reduce grant recipient reporting burden, effective 1 JAN 2019, use of the SF-424B is optional. Also, effective 1 JAN 2020, the SAM will become the central repository for common government-wide certifications and representations required of Federal grants recipients. As registration in SAM is required for eligibility for a Federal award and registration must be updated annually, Federal agencies will use SAM information to comply with award requirements and avoid increased burden and costs of separate requests for such information, unless the recipient fails to meet a Federal award requirement, or there is a need to make updates to their SAM registration for other purposes. (OMB Memorandum M 18-24).</p>\r\n<p>5. DATA RIGHTS:</p>\r\n<p>a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.</p>\r\n<p>b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. <br /><br />1. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.<br />2. The Air Force Research Laboratory is engaged in the discovery, development, and integration of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace forces. As such, rights in technical data and noncommercial computer software (NCS) developed or delivered under this contract are of significant concern to the Government. The Government will therefore carefully consider any restrictions on the use of technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation which could result in transition difficulty or less-than full and open competition for subsequent development of this technology.<br />3. Third Party Software. DFARS 252.227-7014(d) describes requirements for incorporation of third party computer software. Any third party software (commercial and noncommercial) to be incorporated into a deliverable must be clearly identified in the proposal. Prior to delivery of any third party software, the contractor will obtain an appropriate license for the Government, and the written approval of the contracting officer.</p>\r\n<p>c. IDENTIFICATION &amp; ASSERTION. IAW DFARS 252.227-7017, the Identification and assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restriction provision applies. See AFRL/RI Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions for further guidance and samples.</p>\r\n<p>6. REPORTING: <br />a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br />b. FAPIIS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>\r\n<p>7. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br />(a) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />(b) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />(c) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls<br />d. DFARS 252.215-7013, Supplies and Services Provided by Nontraditional Defense Contractors <br /><br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>\r\n<p>8. GRANT AWARDS ONLY: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. If the proposal is selected for award, the DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>\r\n<p><strong>VII.
