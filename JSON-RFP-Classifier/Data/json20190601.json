However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Price alone is the sole evaluation factor.  In addition to the general standards of responsibility found at FAR § 9.104-1, in accordance with FAR § 9.104-2, the special standards of responsibility described below apply to this procurement.  Offerors who fail to meet any general or special standard of responsibility will not be eligible to receive contract award.\nSpecial Standards of Responsibility:  The following special standards of responsibility apply to this procurement:  \nSP1: Special Licensure.  All drivers shall hold a valid driver s license issued by the state of Colorado. \nSP2: Special Insurance Offeror shall be a licensed courier company covered by a minimum of $500,000 in liability insurance.\nSP3: Special Insurance All vehicles to perform work under the contract shall have valid auto registration and shall be covered by the legally required auto insurance levels for the state of Colorado.\nSP4: Special Vehicle Requirements All vehicles to perform work under the contract shall be equipped with at least one up-to-date complete  SPILL KIT  for bio-hazard cleanup in case of leakage or accidental discharge as well as either two-way radios, cell phones, or pagers for communication purposes.\nSP5: Special Vehicle Requirements All vehicles to perform work under the contract shall be of sufficient size to carry a minimum of four 2 x2 x2  boxes or coolers.\nSP6: Special Training Requirements All personnel to perform work under the contract shall have had training in (or the plan to provide the training prior to working) the transportation of hazardous materials, to include type A and B infectious substances.\nSP7:  Specialized Experience.  Offeror shall be able to describe its specialized experience providing daily courier service to include time and temperature sensitive packages.\n(b) Evaluation Process. Quotes will be evaluated in the following manner.  The lowest-priced quote will be identified.  The lowest-priced quote will be evaluated to determine if the quoted price exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement.  If the quoted price does not exceed the amount of funding available for the procurement, the quoted price will be evaluated to determine if it is reasonable.  If the quoted price is found to be reasonable, the offeror who submitted this quote will be identified as the  successful offeror.   The contracting officer will then determine if the successful offeror is responsible using the general standards of responsibility and the special standards of responsibility applicable to this procurement.  If contract award cannot be made to the successful offeror, the contracting officer will evaluate the next lowest-priced quote following the procedures described above.  This process will continue until a contract award can be made, or the contracting officer determines that no contract award can be made.  The contracting officer may find all quotes not acceptable and cancel the solicitation if the lowest-priced quote exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement.  The contracting officer may likewise find a quote under evaluation, as well as all remaining quotes, not acceptable and cancel the solicitation if the quote currently under evaluation exceeds the amount of funding available for the procurement.  The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions at any time if determined by the contracting officer to be in the Government s interest.\nIf two or more offerors submit identical low prices, as long as all general and special responsibility standards are met, preference will be given to verified SDVOSBs, followed by verified VOSBs, then to all other types of small businesses.\n(c) Options.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced or if the quoted price for the basic requirement or any option exceeds the amount of funding available for any of those requirements.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  \n(End of provision)\nOfferors not already registered in SAM must to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items. See https://orca.bpn.gov/ for online submittal);\nThe clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; is incorporated by reference, applies to this acquisition with following addendum: \nThe following FAR clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated in full text:\n52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)\nThe Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.\nFor the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows:\nThe evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but not for more than a total of six months during the life of the contract.  The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised.  The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise.  This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8. The `specified' rates under this clause will be those rates in effect under the contract each time an option is exercised under this clause.\n\n(End of Clause)\n52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)\n  (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of the contract end date; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.\n  (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.\n  (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years.\n(End of Clause)\n52.228-5 INSURANCE WORK ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION (JAN 1997)\n  (a) The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the entire performance of this contract, at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract.\n  (b) Before commencing work under this contract, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective \n    (1) For such period as the laws of the State in which this contract is to be performed prescribe; or\n    (2) Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.\n  (c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts under this contract that require work on a Government installation and shall require subcontractors to provide and maintain the insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract. The Contractor shall maintain a copy of all subcontractors' proofs of required insurance, and shall make copies available to the Contracting Officer upon request.\n(End of Clause)\nSUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS\n  In accordance with FAR 28.307-2 and FAR 52.228-5, the following minimum coverage shall apply to this contract:\n  (a)  Workers' compensation and employer s liability:  Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes.  If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a Contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage.  Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 is required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers.\n  (b)  General Liability: $500,000.00 per occurrences.\n  (c)  Automobile liability: $200,000.00 per person; $500,000.00 per occurrence and $20,000.00 property damage.\n (End of Clause)\n52.232-19  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR  (APR 1984)\nFunds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond September 30 of ANY fiscal year.  The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond September 30 of ANY fiscal year, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.\n(End of Clause)\n\nThe following FAR clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: 52.204-9 PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL (JAN 2011), 52.204-13 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT MAINTENANCE (OCT 2018), 52.204-18 COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY CODE MAINTENANCE (JUL 2016), 52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS (DEC 2013),\n\nThe following VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) clauses applies and is incorporated in full text: \nVAAR 852.203-70 COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING (JAN 2008)\n   The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor (End of Clause)\nVAAR 852.215-71  EVALUATION FACTOR COMMITMENTS (DEC 2009)\nThe offeror agrees, if awarded a contract, to use the service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or veteran-owned small businesses proposed as subcontractors (if subcontractors are contemplated) in accordance with 852.215-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors, or to substitute one or more service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or veteran-owned small businesses for subcontract work of the same or similar value.\n(End of Clause)\nVAAR 852.219-75  SUBCONTRACTING COMMITMENTS MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE (JUL 2018)\n  (a) This solicitation includes the clause: 852.215-70   Service-disabled veteran-owned and veteran-owned small business evaluation factors.
