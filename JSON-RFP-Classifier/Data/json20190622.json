The rationale for this sole single-source justification is NCATS has been using neurons generated by BrainXell in research projects for the previous two years. For this ongoing research, NCATS needs to maintain consistency of data already collected over the past two years by continuing to obtain neurons with the exact specifications of maturation rate, quality and other characteristics as those previously generated by BrainXell. This is necessary in order to properly continue the research and accurately compare data gathered. In addition, BrainXell possesses a unique, proprietary mixture of growth factors that accelerates the maturation of neurons into fully mature neurons in less than five (5) days.<br /><br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) Number 2019-02, with effective date June 5, 2019.<br /><br />(iv) This requirement has no set-aside restrictions.

Offers will be evaluated by performing a comparative evaluation in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3) to determine which response represents the  best  as a whole. \n\nQuotes will be evaluated by performing a direct comparison of one offer with another in a uniform manner to determine which quote provides the government with its needs, as identified in the RFQ.  The government reserves the right to consider a response that offers more than the minimum and select that response if it provides a benefit to the government. The government has the discretion to accept other than the lowest priced offeror that provides additional benefits. The government also has the discretion to make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations/offers having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best benefit to the government. \n\nThe following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:\n\nPricing:  The sum of all the CLINs, to include options, will represent the total evaluated price.  Proposed price must be determined to be fair and reasonable to be eligible for award.\n\nFair and Reasonable Determination\nA fair and reasonable price determination will be made through any combination of the following methods:\nComparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. \nComparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for like items. \nUse of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry. \nComparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements. \nComparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. \nComparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items. \nAnalysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. \nBecause below-cost prices are not inherently improper, when vendors are competing for award of a fixed-price contract, vendors are given notice that a business decision to submit a low-priced quotation may be considered as reflecting on their understanding of the contract requirements or the risk associated with their approach.\nOfferors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing.  Unbalanced pricing exits when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items for the base and or option years is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.\nTechnical Acceptability\nQualification of all Personnel (training, experience, certifications)\nSufficient Personnel/Equipment- list of all equipment to be utilized in this contract as well as staffing and the tasks they will perform, number of total persons to be working\nEquipment List \nList of proposed supplies\nList of Subcontractors business names (if being used) and the tasks and/or CLINS they will perform\nWrite up detailing the technical methods and management of completing contract tasks\nAmount of time estimated to complete each CLIN\nNumber of employees you expect a cycle requires\nWhat is the plan to cover/correct employee absences, vacations and low staffing levels?\nInformation will be evaluated on it demonstrating an understanding of the work requirements (Adequate Performance Plan) \nOnly restating the SOW and/or not detailing the number of subcontractor s laborers and exactly the work they will be doing may lead to your proposal being considered non-responsive and not considered further.\nPast Performance (CPARS, Past Performance Questionnaire, and additional information the Contracting Officer may obtain that speaks to the contractor s level of experience in this field)\n\nSDVOSB Status verification in CVE\n\nProposal Contents:\n\n-Pricing shall be submitted as requested in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.\n-Technical Package for Evaluation (a redacted copy of the technical quote removing ALL company names and identifiable information is REQUIRED) ..a quote may be considered non-responsive if a redacted copy of the technical quote is not received and therefore may be removed from further consideration for award.\n\n\nThe following shall be included as part of the quoters submission(See Technical Acceptability Above) :\nExperience of company and subcontractors anticipated to perform work under this contract\nManagerial & Technical Qualifications of key personnel\nQualifications of any proposed sub-contractors and the percentage of work they will be performing.\n-Past Performance.
