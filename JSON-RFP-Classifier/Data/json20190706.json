This work involves construction of a new 5-lane dual leaf bascule bridge over the AIWW, Dismal Swamp Canal (DSC), at the community of Deep Creek in the City of Chesapeake, Virginia. The new bridge will replace an existing 2-lane, single leaf bascule bridge Constructed in 1934 on George Washington Highway (U.S. Route 17). The project includes a 5-lane dual-leaf bascule bridge with a sidewalk on the south side, approach slabs, abutments, supporting piers, piles, pile caps, bulkheads, fender system, mechanical and electrical systems, lighting, emergency power generation, controls, radio, signage on the bridge, operator's control house with HVAC, lighting, toilet, and parking.</p>\r\n<p>Magnitude of construction cost: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. Estimated completion date is 1095 calendar days from notice to proceed.<br />a) PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br />b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organization if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:<br />c) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency I Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters, and<br />d) Be consistent with law.<br />Reference: Provision 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement<br />Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement</p>\r\n<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are response to the following questions:<br />1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.<br />2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? Are these large scale construction projects I the area (over $25M, within 50 miles of Chesapeake, VA) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for execution of the project? Please provide supporting documentation.<br />3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.<br />4. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit for a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />5. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?<br />6. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.<br />7. Please identify and additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>\r\n<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Mr. Scott Brainerd at email: Allen.S.Brainerd@usace.army.mil and a copy to Dianne Grimes, Contracting Officer at Dianne.k.grimes@usace.army.mil no later than 10:00 AM EST on 22 July 2019.</p>\r\n<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.
