CSU is the only known institution that conducts BSL3 research studies using goats and Burkholderia pseudomal/ei. Working with Burkholderia pseudomallei (classified by the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a Tier 1 Select Agent) requires select agent certification and BSL-3 laboratory space.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation: No. NIMH-19-004845 includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2019-1 simplified procedures for commercial items. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.\r\n<p>This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 1000 Employees is being considered.<br />Only one award will be made because of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br />BACKGROUND</p>\r\n<p>The NIMH is the Federal agency responsible for conducting and supporting research on the brain and mental disorders. This research brings hope and effective treatments to the millions of people who suffer from mental disorders, which also benefit their families and friends. Thus, communicating research through distribution of NIMH printed materials provides information to the public and to the professionals who provide for their care. <br />Imaging the distribution of a fluorescent label in brain tissue sections is an essential step for experiments that are being carried out by many basic science investigators within the NIMH intramural program. In order to better preserve the morphology of tissue, it is often necessary to section it coarsely (&gt;1mm) and then optically clear it. The resulting large sections of cleared tissue require many hours or days of imaging on a conventional confocal microscope. Using a light sheet microscope however, reduces the acquisition time to minutes - dramatically accelerating an experimental pipeline. One such light sheet microscope (DISPIM) already exists in AIM and is currently being used to image live or fixed/cleared samples - each of which require a different configuration of the microscope. NIMH is funding the construction of a partial clone of this microscope dedicated for cleared tissue imaging (CT-DISPIM) on which NIMH users would receive priority. The CT-DISPIM is capable of volumetric acquisition from 1-10mm scale tissue samples within minutes with a spatial resolution adequate to trace neurites. Using an illumination source with several different wavelengths that can be independently triggered and modulated allows the microscope to image multiple labels in the same sample, greatly increasing the information content that can be obtained from a single sample. The combination of high speed, high volume, high content, and high resolution will be enabling for a variety of projects, including: mapping of injection sites when stereological injections are performed as part of functional opto- or chemo-genetic experiments, mapping projections as part of studies defining the connections of specific neuronal populations, and quantifying changes in gene expression in behavior paradigms.</p>\r\n<p>NIMH and the trans-NIH Advanced Imaging and Microscopy (AIM) Resource are working together to build a dualview selective plane illumination microscope dedicated to rapidly imaging large samples of chemically cleared brain tissue (CT-DISPIM). This microscope is a modified clone of an existing system at AIM and requires an illumination source - a set of 4 lasers with different wavelengths, each with &gt;100mW power, that can be individually triggered and modulated by our existing control systems. The existing microscope uses a Coherent OBIS Laser Box as its illumination source, therefore a Coherent OBIS Laser Box or \"equal\" laser box is required to clone the microscope. Any laser box or lasers that are not compatible with the modified dualview selective plane illumination microscope will not be considered. <br />The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), plans to procure the following Coherent OBIS Laser Box and Lasers or \"equal\" laser box and lasers:<br />1. OBIS 405nm LX 100mW laser;<br />2. OBIS 488nm LX 150mW laser;<br />3. OBIS 561nm LS 150mW laser;<br />4. OBIS 637nm LX 140mW laser;<br />5. 5 bay OBIS laser box with Power Supply and USA Power Cord.</p>\r\n<p>Any laser box or lasers that are not compatible with the modified dualview selective plane illumination microscope will not be considered. <br />The salient characteristics that apply to this acquisition are as follows:<br />The four laser system must have the following characteristics:</p>\r\n<p>1. 4 independent, swappable diode lasers with wavelengths 405nm, 488nm, 561nm, and 637nm;<br />2. The power of all laser lines are 100mW or greater;<br />3. Each laser line can me modulated via digital trigger and analogue power modulation;<br />4. All control is via ASI DISPIM plugin on Micromangager;<br />5. Compatible with existing control software and hardware;<br />6. Spatial mode TEM00;<br />7. Pointing stability &lt;30 urad over 2 hours;<br />8. Power stability &lt;2% over 8 hours;<br />9. RMS noise &lt;0.25% from 20Hz to 20MHz;<br />10. Polarization ratio &gt;100:1 vertical; and<br />11.
