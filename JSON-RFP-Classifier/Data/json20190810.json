The government reserves the right to consider a response that offers more than the minimum and select that response if it provides a benefit to the government. The government has the discretion to accept other than the lowest priced quote that provides additional benefits. The government also has the discretion to make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best benefit to the government. \n\nThe following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:\n\nPricing:  The sum of all the CLINs, to include options, will represent the total evaluated price.  Proposed price must be determined to be fair and reasonable in order to be eligible for award in terms of reasonableness and realism using any or all of the methods listed below.\nComparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. \nComparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for like items. \nUse of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry. \nComparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements. \nComparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. \nComparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items. \nAnalysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. \nBecause below-cost prices are not inherently improper, when vendors are competing for award of a fixed-price contract, vendors are given notice that a business decision to submit a low-priced quotation may be considered as reflecting on their understanding of the contract requirements or the risk associated with their approach.\nContractors are cautioned against submitting a quote that contains unbalanced pricing.  Unbalanced pricing exits when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items for the base and or option years is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. Quotesthat are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.\n\n\nTechnical Acceptability\nQualification of all Personnel (training, experience, certifications)\nSufficient Personnel/Equipment- list of all equipment to be utilized in this contract as well as staffing and the tasks they will perform, number of total persons to be on the ground working\nEquipment List shall have the models, horse power and ages of the motorized equipment\nList of proposed supplies\nList of Subcontractors business names (if being used) and the tasks and/or CLINS they will perform\nWrite up detailing the technical methods and management of completing a cycle\nNumber of hours you believe each CLIN requires per cycle\nNumber of employees you expect a cycle requires\nWhat is the plan to cover/correct employee absences, vacations and low staffing levels?\nPlease provide a Gantt chart containing the employees, equipment and hours for all tasks in the CLINs\nInformation will be evaluated on it demonstrating an understanding of the work requirements (Adequate Performance Plan) \n3.
