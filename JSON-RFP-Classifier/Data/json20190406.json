Therefore, the Offeror is invited to propose alternative line items for which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Offeror.<br /> <br />(b) The Offeror may submit one or more additional proposals with alternative line items, provided that alternative line items are consistent with subpart 4.10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>\r\n<p>The award will be made to the contractor whose price is the lowest of all offers who are determined to be technically qualified of performing the required service and providing the requested product in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items. No trade-offs are made. The Government may make an award based on initial quotes received without discussions with Contractors. Accordingly, each offer should be submitted in a completed form, without exception to any requirements.</p>\r\n<p>It is incumbent upon the Contractor to submit sufficient information for the Government to determine technical acceptability. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>\r\n<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>\r\n<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. PRICE:<br />(a) Contractors SHALL complete and submit the price schedule with their quote and include a price for each line item. Failure to do so will result in the offer being rejected without further consideration.<br />b. The Contracting Officer will evaluate each quote in accordance with FAR 15.404-1 to determine price reasonableness. In this context, reasonableness will be determined by comparing quotes to one another, to the Government estimate and to pricing for previous work of a similar nature.</p>\r\n<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>\r\n<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>\r\n<p>(End of provision)</p>\r\n<p>52.212-5     CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2018)</p>\r\n<p>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:</p>\r\n<p>(1) 52.203-19, Prohibition on Requiring Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements (JAN 2017) (section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.
