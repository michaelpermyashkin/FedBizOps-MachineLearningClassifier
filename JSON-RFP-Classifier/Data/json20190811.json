This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), for the procurement entitled \"Decommissioning Orphaned Liabilities on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.\"  The BSEE, Acquisition Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at www.sam.gov in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to competitively award multiple award Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contracts for the effort described herein.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 213112, \"Support Activities for Oil and Gas Operations\".   The contract will be procured on an unrestricted basis.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to consist of a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.\n\nThe BSEE, a bureau within the DOI, has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and is charged with promoting safety, protecting the environment, and conserving resources offshore, through regulatory oversight and enforcement.  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA) establishes BSEE's jurisdiction.  \n\nBSEE was created to oversee offshore worker safety, environmental stewardship, and resource conservation.  BSEE's mission is fulfilled by employing a spectrum of statutory authorities that are designed to reduce offshore risk and improve the ability of companies to respond effectively should an incident occur.\n\nBSEE is responsible for ensuring a consistent, National approach to detection of noncompliance and incident investigation; examining the full life cycle of offshore operations and adapting to changing conditions; incorporating risk-based decision making into core safety functions; and enforcing all environmental protection and oil spill preparedness requirements.\n\nWhen a Lessee or Holder enters into a lease or grant for offshore oil or gas exploration or production, the agreement includes a \"decommissioning\" (i.e., plugging and abandoning wells, flushing and removing or filling pipelines, removing structures, and clearing the seafloor) obligation.  BSEE's decommissioning regulatory authority is established by 43 U.S. Code 1334 and 30 CFR ยง 250, Subpart Q, Decommissioning Activities.\n\nThe objective of this procurement is to obtain contractor support to decommission orphaned facilities.  Decommissioning means returning the lease or grant to a condition that meets the requirements of BSEE and other agencies that have jurisdiction over decommissioning activities.  Orphaned facilities are infrastructure (i.e., wells, structures, or pipelines) that industry abandoned or that otherwise reverted back to the DOI without being properly decommissioned, and for which sole liability rests on the defaulting lessee, holder, or operator.  That is, no viable co-lessee or prior lessee or holder is jointly or severally liable for the decommissioning.  The maintenance, monitoring, and decommissioning costs associated with such orphaned facilities is called orphaned liability.  Decommissioning task orders may be issued for any OCS region, including the Gulf of Mexico Region (GOMR), the Pacific Region (POCSR), and the Alaska Region (AKOCSR). \n\nHOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If your organization is interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your organization's name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address and DUNS Number via email to Rebecca.Kruse@bsee.gov by 4:00 p.m. ET 26 August 2019.

Through several recent and ongoing projects, LBN is studying the metabolic correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brain. In the proposed project, NIA wish to extend these studies to study the metabolic basis of cognitive resilience using human and rat brain tissue samples. Using quantitative and targeted metabolomics analyses of brain and blood tissue samples, we have identified abnormalities in several metabolic pathways that are associated with severity of AD pathology in the brain and expression of clinical symptoms. Some older individuals appear to be cognitively resilient as they do not show signs of cognitive impairment despite significant AD pathology in the brain. NIA wish to further understand this phenomenon by performing identical quantitative and targeted metabolomics analyses of autopsy-derived brain tissue samples from human subjects comparing APOE &epsilon;4 carriers to non-carriers. The rationale for this study is that comparing regional brain metabolic profiles in relation to APOE genotype, the most robust genetic risk factor for AD, will provide unique insights into how this AD risk gene regulates brain metabolism. Comparing these metabolic signatures to those associated with AD pathology (derived from prior studies) may help identify the metabolic basis of APOE-mediated risk for AD and cognitive resilience in APOE &epsilon;4 non-carriers. The second goal of the study is to compare regional brain metabolic profiles in a rat model of cognitive aging developed by NIA Researchers. NIA will perform quantitative and targeted metabolomics to examine regional brain metabolic changes in three groups of rats; aged-cognitively-impaired (AI), aged-cognitively-unimpaired (AU) and young unimpaired (YU).

Recent studies on human brain tissue samples in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) reveal several metabolic abnormalities in brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology. Some of these abnormalities may present novel targets for effective disease-modifying AD treatments. NIA now wish to extend these findings by confirming them in a larger set of samples in the BLSA as well as in an independent cohort i.e. Religious Orders Study (ROS). Using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) on human brain tissue samples, NIA have identified several metabolic abnormalities in AD including in polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions. Prior to testing whether correcting these abnormalities in experimental models may be of utility as novel treatments, it is essential to confirm these novel findings in a larger sample size and in independent cohorts. In the proposed acquisition, the objective is to apply the same techniques as in the original study to confirm index results in BLSA and ROS-derived brain tissue samples.</p>\r\n<p>Project Requirements: Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the Statement of Work below.</p>\r\n<p>The main objective of the requirement is but not limited to the following: (1) Measure the concentration of polar and hydrophilic small metabolites in three hundred and ninety-four (394) human brain tissue samples using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS).
