Some of these molecules are potential components for diagnostic kits to be used for the rapid detection of nucleic acids associated with diseases.  The development of new diagnostic kits to signal the early stages of infections or cancers could be of great benefit to human health and thus to NIDDK's mission. To make cyPNAs and study their binding to nucleic acid sequences, it is essential to have the correct starting materials.  The NIDDK lab has shown that the incorporation of trans-cyclopentanediamine into PNA backbones improves binding to target nucleic acid sequences. Our research on cyPNA development for the detection of nucleic acids associated with diseases therefore depends on the purchase of the chemicals in this order. These are the essential starting materials we must have for our research to continue. Substantial in vitro work has been done to select cyPNAs to move forward as probes for diseases, which has incurred substantial investment.</p>\r\n<p>The objective of the research is to advance the testing of cyPNA as probes to signal the presence of infection or disease. To properly make cyPNA oligomers, the lab must have the correct building blocks that will be made from the materials to be purchased in this contract. The company must provide 100g each of (1S,2S)-trans-N-Boc- Tetrahydro-3,4-furandiamine and (1R,2R)-trans-N-Boc- Tetrahydro-3,4-furandiamine. These materials will be converted into the monomers needed to make cyPNA probes to target specific nucleic acids sequences associated with infection or disease. Results from each set of tests done are added to the file that will eventually be submitted for FDA approval as a new diagnostic test.  The continuity of the project is enhanced by the use of as few CRO's as possible and only ones technically qualified to meet the specific needs of the research.  This is a highly specific research-based purchase to acquire materials that are not commonly produced.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.\n\nThe solicitation number for this procurement is 140A0319Q0019 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Southern Plain Regional Office intends to award a firm-fixed price contract in response to this Request for Quote (RFQ).    \n\nThe solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2019-02 dated May 6, 2019.\n\nThis solicitation is a Small Business set-aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 115310, Support Activities for Forestry and the size standard is $7.5 Mil.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Southern Plains Regional Office, is soliciting offers for the aerial application of broadleaf herbicides.  \n\nPrice Schedule:\n\n13 projects located in Dewey County, Oklahoma (approximately 1,117 acres). The contractor's per acre price shall include the cost of the herbicide, herbicide adjuvants, labor, insurance, superintendence, tools, equipment all miscellaneous expenses and any other items necessary for completion of the tasks.\n\nThe contractor will NOT be reimbursed via a separate CLIN for the actual cost of herbicide applied to each spray block; herbicide costs shall be included in the per acre bid price. \n\nPrice:  $________________________ per acre\n\nDescription of Services:  \n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs Concho Agency requires the service of a contractor to provide broadleaf vegetation spray application of herbicide to an estimated 1,117 acres within the Dewey County area in Oklahoma. Herbicide application will only be conducted on the pasture acres. No cropland is to be treated. This is necessary to keep the federally listed weeds and undesirable plants from taking over the area after the Rhea fire on April 13, 2018 while also improving the native grass ecosystems within the fire scar area.\n\nThe contractor and all persons applying the herbicide shall have a valid Commercial Applicator License. The contractor shall be responsible for the transportation and storage of the supplies and equipment used for the project. The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the application of the herbicide meets all label specifications and is mixed according to the label directions. The contractor shall be responsible for cleanup of accidental spills, following proper handling and storage precautions, and ensuring proper exposure control and personal protection is provided as defined by the herbicide label and Material Safety and Data Sheets.\n\nAccepted application method\nThe Agency will only accept aerial application by helicopter. With the use of helicopter, the agency can cut out the non-target areas of control and avoid herbicide overspray on no-targeted species. The helicopter application allows for a better spot-spray treatment approach. This will reduce the affected area to the specific grass fields within the project boundaries.\n\nThe contractor shall follow the label directions for aerial application, weather conditions and spray drift management to avoid off-target drift movement.\n\nSpray strips shall be patterned in such a manner as to secure as high a uniformity of herbicide distribution as possible.\n\nContractor is responsible for identification and avoidance of any and all hazards.\n\nThe contractor shall comply with all Federal, State, Tribal and local regulations.\n\nThe projects are located in Dewey Co and the far northeast part of Custer Co in Oklahoma. See attachment A of the vicinity map and topographic map of each treatment area (there are 5 project maps).\n\nThe contractor shall be allowed to use the following herbicides: GrazonNext HL, Cimarron Max and or Cimarron Plus. All other variations and herbicides will not be accepted. Whichever herbicide is used, the contractor shall follow the recommended label application rate. This can be found on the label that is supplied with the chemical. The contractor shall list in the quote which herbicide will be used in the project. \n\nConditions:\nIf sensitive, endangered, or threatened species (plant or animal) are discovered within the treatment area the contractor shall immediately notify the COR.  The Government may issue a suspend work and/or partially terminate any portion of the work due to discoveries of sensitive, threatened, endangered species or archeological sites during contract operations.\n\nHerbicide shall not be applied within 150 feet of water sources (troughs, ponds, open water).  Contractor is expected to apply the herbicide consistent with the maps.\n\nWhenever a specification from an Agency, State or Federal law; or label direction has a contradiction, the most stringent interpretation shall take precedence.\n\nAll work shall be coordinated with Shane Glory, Project Manager/COR. It is highly recommended that prospective bidders schedule a site visit to discuss the proposed work, assess topography, hazards, project block acreage, vegetation and familiarize themselves with the jobsite. Mr. Shane Glory, BIA Soil Conservationist, can be contacted at (405) 323-0266 or by email at shane.glory@bia.gov.  \n\nNear the completion of the work, the contractor must contact the Project Manager for a site inspection before the contractor leaves the job site.\n\nFor additional technical information pertaining to the solicitation, please contact Tyler Burleson at (405) 898-7227/gregory.burleson@bia.gov or Robert Codopony at (405) 850-6772/robert.codopony@bia.gov.\n\nPeriod of Performance:  19 August 2019 through 30 June 2020\n\nLocation: Dewey County, Oklahoma. See maps for exact locations.\n\nPROVISION FAR 52.212-1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition.  \n\nFAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS \n\n(a)\tThe Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:\n\n(i)\tFactor 1: Technical Capability \n\n1.\t The offeror shall submit their technical approach and demonstrated experience/evidence of ability to successfully perform the services.  Submit information on qualified key personnel and equipment that will be used on the projects.

In addition, the Government may solicit past performance on contracts not listed by the offeror. \n2.\tIf an offeror does not have any past performance information to submit as the entity under which the offer is being submitted, then the offeror should submit past performance data identified above under which the offeror's key personnel have worked.  The offeror's quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance.  The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past projects.  \n3.\tThe Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. \n4.\tAn Offeror without relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating.  \n\n\nTechnical and past performance, when combined, are equal to cost or price.  \n\n(b)\t Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).\n\nA written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.\n\nFAR 52.212-3 - OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS \nThe offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov .

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.\r\n(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the\r\nContractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:\r\n(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.\r\n(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.

The lab is pursuing a study to assess alcohol-induced change of lipid mediators in the brain, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) with the newly acquired JEOL Spinal TOF mass spectrometer. A key step of MADLI MSI involves in uniformly depositing of the matrix onto the entire brain sections. It is necessary to purchase a matrix deposition device with a temperature controllable spray nozzle. By providing superior extraction thus greater signal sensitivity (several-fold more typically), the temperature control is important for imaging very low abundant brain lipids. In addition, controlling the temperature can minimal spatial delocalization resulting in a much higher resolution of images. Currently, HTX TM -SprayerTM and M5 SprayerTM MADLI sample preparation systems, both can control nozzle spray temperature from ambient to 130 oC, are the only two matrix deposition devices on the market that offer matrix spray temperature control. The M5 SprayerTM has all features of TM-SprayerTM and provides 4X faster spay speed, which is particularly suitable for imaging lipids.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Details</strong></span>:<br />1 ea.\t\tTMSP.M5.H02-U<br />System includes spraying booth with drawer, High Speed XY<br />stage, heated spray nozzle, TMSP Control Software 5.1 offering<br />pump and heated stage control, Windows PC, switching valve,<br />5ml loop and necessary fittings.
