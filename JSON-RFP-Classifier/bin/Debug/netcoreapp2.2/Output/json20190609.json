It is designed to aid the Government's COR or designated representative in providing effective and systematic surveillance of all aspects of laundry/linen services. \nThis plan provides for monitoring all contract requirements through a combination of methods. These are: \nSampling guides \nCustomer complaint surveillance guides; and \nSurveillance activity checklist. \nThe objective of this surveillance plan is to evaluate how the Contractor is performing in key areas. \nThe principal method of surveillance will be the random sampling of the quantity and quality of laundered items processed. The plan contains sampling guides for use in random sampling. It contains random sampling (tally) checklists which are used to record information about the random samples. \n\nTasks not surveyed by random sampling will be covered by daily observation in some cases or by use or periodic checklist inspections. Appropriate checklists are provided for recording observations in this type of surveillance. \nNotwithstanding the provisions of the contract covering inspection, acceptance, and deduction from payment, any items found to have been unsatisfactorily cleaned shall be re-cleaned at no additional cost to the Government. Such items shall be identified, for Contractor recognition, by the COR when they are returned on the next scheduled pickup after an unsatisfactory condition is discovered. \n\n\nHow to use the Surveillance Plan:\nThis surveillance plan has been organized to facilitate use by the COR or designated representative. It is the COR s responsibility to develop a monthly schedule for activities based on the surveillance plan s requirements. The monthly schedule will be completed by the last workday of the preceding month and a copy will be submitted to a CO or other management official for information and review by an assigned workday of the month.\n \nTo build the inspection schedule, the COR or designated representative will select areas and times for the random sampling using the procedures shown in the surveillance plan. Periodic checklist items to be surveyed during the month will be programmed into the schedule to facilitate their accomplishment. This monthly schedule should show what the COR or designated representative is monitoring each day. Changes will be posted weekly and copies sent to appropriate officials. The reasons for changes will be fully documented and explained. Actual surveillance activity must be comparable to the monthly schedule. The responsible management official must be able to observe a COR s or designated representative s performance by using the monthly schedule, as updated. \n\nOne should be able to conduct a complete audit trail from the monthly schedule by observing the COR or designated representative perform sampling or other checklist surveillance, and completion of tally and other checklists. An auditor should be able to track from the above items to the management s actions (payment deductions or other actions as necessary if contract service is being performed), described on a CDR. \n\nMonthly tally checklists will be prepared for each sampling guide and will be used to record information on observations and defects. Each observation in the sampling will be recorded on the tally checklists. These documents will then become a formal record for later reference. The tally of observations and defects at the end of each month will be compared to the acceptable number of defects appearing in the relevant sampling guide. Any errors detected during the course of the surveillance, even if not of sufficient degree to render the service unsatisfactory in terms of the AQL parameters, will require corrective action by the Contractor. \nErrors detected by the COR or designated representative in the course of surveillance will be communicated to the Contractor. Notification of errors will take place within 1 working day. Specifics concerning any errors should be recorded on the tally checklist. The Contractor should be asked to initial this record. \n\nIf the sampling guide indicates that the number of defects is too high, the current month s service will be considered unsatisfactory. If performance in any area is judged unsatisfactory, based on random sampling or other criteria as set forth in ( Summary Table ) in Performance Standard section of  PWS.  Contractor will be given a CDR by the COR or designated representative. When completed and signed, the CDR, along with the tally checklist becomes the documentation supporting payment or nonpayment or other actions as necessary for Contractor provided services. \n\nThere are some requirements in a contract which are more conveniently monitored on an individual periodic basis. For example, a Contractor is required to provide continuing training. When these items are checked (quarterly and monthly, for example), the deficiencies will be recorded on the appropriate checklist. When these items are discovered to be unsatisfactory, actions as described above will be taken. For the number of allowable defects. \n\n\nCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (CPARS)\nFAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The Department of Veterans Affairs has implemented use of the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15.\n\nThe past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.\n\nPlease furnish the Contracting Officer with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm s past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official. The report information must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.\n\nWhen your Contractor Representative(s) (Past Performance Points of Contact) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically-generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, system requirements, and training information for CPARS are available at www.cpars.gov. The CPARS User Manual, registration for online training for Contractor Representatives may be found at this site.\n(e) Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the Contracting Officer will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation and the report will be accessible at www.cpars.gov Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment. Comments are limited to the space provided in Block 22. Your comments should focus on objective facts in the Assessing Official s narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance. In addition to the ratings and supporting narratives, blocks 1-17 should be reviewed for accuracy, as these include key fields that will be used by the Government to identify your firm in future source selection evaluations. If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating,  No Comment  in Block 22, and then signing and dating Block 23 of the form. Without a statement in Block 22, you will be unable to sign and submit the evaluation back to the Government. If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 30 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated:  The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment.  Your response is due within 30 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR.\nThe following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:\n             (1) Protect the evaluation as  source selection information.  After review, transit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for instructions.\n             (2) Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.\n             (3) Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, preaward surveys, responsibility determination, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.\n\n        (g) If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 30-day review period.\n        (h) A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been completed.\n\nEND","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/VA/BroVANAP/VAMD/36C24219Q0794/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"Eulanda.James@va.gov","DESC3":"Contracting Officer","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"USA","POPZIP":"10468","POPADDRESS":"Department of Veterans Affairs; James  J.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
