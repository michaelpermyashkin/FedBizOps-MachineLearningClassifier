The work in general consists of field investigations, conducting all required studies/reports, attending meetings/conferences, for BIM support, preparation of Landscape Design, Architectural Renderings, Comprehensive Interior Design (CID), LEED Documentation online, LEED Design Notebook, Energy Modeling, and related pre-final, back check, and contract documents, and other A-E services. The design work is to be performed for HAS Phase 1, 2 and 3 Kunsan Airbase Korea.</p>\r\n<p>The statutory authority for this non-competitive acquisition is 10 United States Code 2304(c)(1) as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; this is a follow-on contract available only from the original source and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The original design contract, W912UM-13-D-0003-0030 was awarded 30 July 2015 to AMKOR A&amp;E Inc. for the design of Calendar Year (CY) 2015 Republic of Korea Funded Construction (ROKFC) In-Kind Combine Design Packages for Hardened Aircraft Shelters Phase 1, 2, and 3 at Kunsan Airbase, Korea. Work included, but not limited to fire protection engineering, electrical engineering and other services and tasks including BIM, interior design, energy modeling, landscape design, LEED support and rendering.</p>\r\n<p>The construction of this design has begun, however, due to complications involving the current design during construction in early 2019 regarding the location of the currently designed drainage line \"N\". Current drainage system connects to off-base irrigation of local farmland. Construction of overflow drainage ceased immediately following the complications. Immediate re-design is required in order to maintain project progress towards its scheduled completion of May 2020. Failure to perform the re-design on or around October 30 2019 will result in delay of project completion, resulting in additional costs due to anticipated impact on paving schedule at the rate of an estimated $10,000 per day to the Government for contractor's overhead, as well as impact to the using agency's occupancy plan for these 20 new aircraft shelters.</p>\r\n<p>Because AMKOR A&amp;E has already performed the majority of the services related to the design, using that architect engineer contractor's services for the design of this project will avoid duplication in cost of the previous design. If we were to compete this requirement to a different firm, the Government would require the incoming A-E firm to assume responsibility for the entire design due to the additional requirement of contractor sequencing.</p>\r\n<p>Selection of another AE for this contract would increase FED's costs of obtaining the desired design services, since other AE firms would need to perform greater effort to evaluate and validate the existing AMKOR design and prepare their input towards the re-design of this project. Moreover, selecting another AE would result in a scenario with 2 different designers of record for inter-related projects. Using competitive selection procedures would be unacceptable because such a selection would take an estimated 4 months just to advertise, negotiate and award. By comparison, negotiation and execution of the work under the projected purchase order is expected to take 1.5 months, which results in an estimated savings in 2.5 months in construction, which can meet current construction schedule requirements with minimum impact.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE POSTED.</p>\r\n<p>The Government intends to proceed with this sole source action. The NAICS code is 541310, Architectural Services.</p>\r\n<p><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quote to the contracting officer before the notice end date. If no affirmative written responses are received by 09:00 AM (Korea Standard Time) on 3 July 2019, an award will be made without further notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br />Electronic responses and questions shall be submitted via email to hye-kyong.chon@usace.army.mil.

The TAF Building is an above ground 3-story structure. The 2nd and 3rd floors of which is the focus of this statement of work. The dimensions of the 2nd floor are 17,694.7ft2 with 52 rooms and the dimensions of the 3rd floor are 11,119.1ft2 with 36 rooms. The TAF building's current Information Technology (IT) network infrastructure supports 3 different NATO communications enclaves: NATO Unclassified (NU), NATO Secret (NS), and the NATO Mission Secret (MS) networks. These three enclaves combined are known as the NATO network which is composed of both fibre optic and category 5 enhanced (CAT5e) cabling. The NATO network supports and provides access to both classified and unclassified information via 300 network connections disseminated throughout the second and third floors of the TAF building. The NATO network is administered by a government contractor (NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) CIS Support Unit Lisbon detachment) who manages the NATO network connectivity to both classified and unclassified servers via 4 network switch rooms located in various locations within the TAF building. The NATO network combined with 50 individual air conditioning units, overhead lighting and various appliances within the TAF building exceeds the electrical load of the current electrical distribution system resulting in intermittent power outages throughout the building. Therefore, upgrading the NATO IT network will also involve upgrading the electrical distribution systems to support the increased electrical load required to support the increased number of computers, monitors, network routers, and switches that will be installed during this project. Furthermore, the spaces housing the upgraded network will increase air conditioning usage to keep the equipment and personnel working within these spaces cool. This requirement will increase the amount of electricity required for STRIKFORNATO to operate in the TAF building. These are the primary factors supporting the requirement for the TAF building's electrical system upgrade during this installation.</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/SACLANT/SACLANTHQ/IFIB-ACT-SFN-19-37/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"PT","POPADDRESS":"Headquarters Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO, Reduto Gomes Freire, Estrada da Medrosa, 2780-070 Oeiras, Portugal.\nOeiras"},{"DATE":"0616","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Agency for International Development","OFFICE":"Overseas Missions","LOCATION":"Afghanistan USAID-Kabul","ZIP":"N/A","CLASSCOD":"70","NAICS":"334118","OFFADD":"U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\r\nU.S. Embassy\r\nGreat Masood Road\r\nKabul, Afghanistan Kabul 1","SUBJECT":"HP LaserJet Printers, and Parts","SOLNBR":"72030619R00017","RESPDATE":"071119","CONTACT":"Manaye Abera, Procurement Lead, Email mabera@usaid.gov - Shireenzada, Lutfullah, Procurement Agent, Email lshireenzada@usaid.gov","DESC":"<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Combined Synopsis/Solicitation:</span></strong>\r\n<div><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><br /></span></strong>i)\tThis is a combined synopsis/solicitation (\"solicitation\") hereafter, which is expected to result in award of a firm-fixed- price contract for providing HP LaserJet Printers, and Parts, as per the attached Requirement Description.

The TAF Building is an above ground 3-story structure. The 2nd and 3rd floors of which is the focus of this statement of work. The dimensions of the 2nd floor are 17,694.7ft2 with 52 rooms and the dimensions of the 3rd floor are 11,119.1ft2 with 36 rooms. The TAF building's current Information Technology (IT) network infrastructure supports 3 different NATO communications enclaves: NATO Unclassified (NU), NATO Secret (NS), and the NATO Mission Secret (MS) networks. These three enclaves combined are known as the NATO network which is composed of both fibre optic and category 5 enhanced (CAT5e) cabling. The NATO network supports and provides access to both classified and unclassified information via 300 network connections disseminated throughout the second and third floors of the TAF building. The NATO network is administered by a government contractor (NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) CIS Support Unit Lisbon detachment) who manages the NATO network connectivity to both classified and unclassified servers via 4 network switch rooms located in various locations within the TAF building. The NATO network combined with 50 individual air conditioning units, overhead lighting and various appliances within the TAF building exceeds the electrical load of the current electrical distribution system resulting in intermittent power outages throughout the building. Therefore, upgrading the NATO IT network will also involve upgrading the electrical distribution systems to support the increased electrical load required to support the increased number of computers, monitors, network routers, and switches that will be installed during this project. Furthermore, the spaces housing the upgraded network will increase air conditioning usage to keep the equipment and personnel working within these spaces cool. This requirement will increase the amount of electricity required for STRIKFORNATO to operate in the TAF building. These are the primary factors supporting the requirement for the TAF building's electrical system upgrade during this installation.</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/SACLANT/SACLANTHQ/IFIB-ACT-SFN-19-37/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"PT","POPADDRESS":"Headquarters Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO, Reduto Gomes Freire, Estrada da Medrosa, 2780-070 Oeiras, Portugal.\nOeiras"},{"DATE":"0616","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Department of the Navy","OFFICE":"Naval Facilities Engineering Command","LOCATION":"NAVFAC MID-ATLANTIC PWD Crane FEAD","ZIP":"47522","CLASSCOD":"S","NAICS":"561730","OFFADD":"N40085 NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic, PWD CRANE FEAD 300 Highway 361 NSA Bldg 2516 Crane, IN","SUBJECT":"S--GROUNDS MAINTENANCE SERVICES AT THE NAVAL SUPPORT ACTIVITY, CRANE, INDIANA AND GLENDORA TEST FACILITY SULLIVAN, INDIANA","SOLNBR":"N4008519R7702","NTYPE":"PRESOL","RESPDATE":"062019","ARCHDATE":"08012019","CONTACT":"Carrie Grimard 812-854-6641 carrie.grimard@navy.mil\nAnnette Taylor at 812-854-2673 or Annette.taylor1@navy.mil","DESC":"Amendment 0001 to Grounds Maintenance solicitation.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/notices/182070385749003e15699eaa97b4e0de","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"Total Small Business","POPCOUNTRY":"US","POPZIP":"47522","POPADDRESS":"300 Highway 361, Crane, IN"},{"DATE":"0616","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Department of Homeland Security","OFFICE":"United States Coast Guard (USCG)","LOCATION":"USCG Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC)","ZIP":"21226-5000","CLASSCOD":"J","OFFADD":"2401 Hawkins Point Road\r\nBuilding 31, Mail Stop 26 Baltimore MD 21226-5000","SUBJECT":"CG STA DEPOE BAY (47272)","SOLNBR":"70Z04019QP3089700","CONTACT":"Janet M Delaney, Contracting Officer, Phone 757 628-4353, Email Janet.M.Delaney@uscg.mil","AWDNBR":"70Z04019PP3089700","AWDAMT":"$85,180.00","AWDDATE":"061419","AWARDEE":"Fred Wahl Marine Construction, Inc., 135 Shipyard Way, Reedsport, OR 97467 US","DESC":"Contract Award Notice for CG STA DEPOE BAY (47272)","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DHS/USCG/USCGELC/Awards/70Z04019PP3089700.html","DESC2":"Link To Document"},{"DATE":"0616","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Department of the Navy","OFFICE":"United States Marine Corps","LOCATION":"MCB Camp Butler -
