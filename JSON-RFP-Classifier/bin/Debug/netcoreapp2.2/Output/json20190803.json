The late summer event is an experiment in community and art influenced by ten main principles: radical inclusion, radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, gifting, decommodification, participation, immediacy and leave no trace. The event takes its name from its culmination, the symbolic ritual of burning of a large wooden effigy that traditionally occurs on the Saturday evening of the event.\n\n4. This is only a Sources Sought Synopsis and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.

This allows the Agency to streamline data management and meet quality standards listed in the Agency data management policy. This requirement is a follow-on purchase order contract to contract #75D30118P02651. The Government has invested considerable time and money on informing and working with the Vendor, and to use another Vendor for this work would require substantial time for a new Vendor to re-perform some of the work already performed under the previous contract. This would create significant delays for the Government, as well as increased costs for the Agency.

The Vendor has written extensive code processing the Government's data. The Vendor is able to quickly transition from the previous contract to the anticipated contract.

The 4150 TapeStation is a low-throughput, easy to use, ready to use system for the analysis of genomic DNA and RNA by small scale gel electrophoresis. The high accuracy and the derivation of a RIN/DIN integrity number ensures quality samples to proceed to further downstream processes such as Next Gen Sequencing. The Government requires a reliable instrument to look at both quantity and quality of genomic matter. The 4150 TapeStation instrument is compatible with the Government's current laboratory equipment, including the Illumina MiSeq NGS machine. The 4150 TapeStation instrument supports genomic quantitation prior to NGS runs. This instrument is highly flexible and allows for single sample analysis in very low volumes with processing times of two minutes or less. The fully-automated 4150 TapeStation require technical pre-run set-ups, which similar equipment reviewed requires. Therefore, this laboratory equipment facilitates reproducible data even with lower skilled users, enabling any laboratory personnel to utilize the equipment and use the equipment for multiple projects. The 4150 TapeStation significantly lowers the Government's risk of unsuccessful NGS runs, which can cost the Government significantly in time and finances.

The government reserves the right to consider a response that offers more than the minimum and select that response if it provides a benefit to the government. The government has the discretion to accept other than the lowest priced quote that provides additional benefits. The government also has the discretion to make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations/offers having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best benefit to the government. \n\nThe following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:\n\n\nPricing:  The sum of all the CLINs, to include options, will represent the total evaluated price.  Quoted price must be determined to be fair and reasonable to be eligible for award.\n\nFair and Reasonable Determination\nA fair and reasonable price determination will be made through any combination of the following methods:\nComparison of quoted prices received in response to the solicitation. \nComparison of previously quoted prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current quoted prices for like items. \nUse of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry. \nComparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements. \nComparison of quoted prices with independent Government cost estimates. \nComparison of quoted prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items. \nAnalysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. \nBecause below-cost prices are not inherently improper, when vendors are competing for award of a fixed-price contract, vendors are given notice that a business decision to submit a low-priced quotation may be considered as reflecting on their understanding of the contract requirements or the risk associated with their approach.\nQuoters are cautioned against submitting a quote that contains unbalanced pricing.  Unbalanced pricing exits when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items for the base and or option years is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. Quotes that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.\n\nTechnical Acceptability\nQualification of all Personnel (training, experience, certifications)\nSufficient Personnel/Equipment- list of all equipment to be utilized in this contract as well as staffing and the tasks they will perform, number of total persons to be working\nEquipment List \nList of proposed supplies\nList of Subcontractors business names (if being used) and the tasks and/or CLINS they will perform\nWrite up detailing the technical methods and management of completing contract tasks\nAmount of time estimated to complete each CLIN\nNumber of employees you expect a daily cycle requires\nWhat is the plan to cover/correct employee absences, vacations and low staffing levels?\nInformation will be evaluated on it demonstrating an understanding of the work requirements (Adequate Performance Plan) \nOnly restating the SOW and/or not detailing the number of subcontractor s laborers and exactly the work they will be doing may lead to your proposal being considered non-responsive and not considered further.\nPast Performance (CPARS, Past Performance Questionnaire, and additional information the Contracting Officer may obtain that speaks to the contractor s level of experience in this field)\n\nSDVOSB Status verification in CVE\n\nQuote Contents:\n\n-Pricing shall be submitted as requested in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.\n-Technical Package for Evaluation (a redacted copy of the technical quote removing ALL company names and identifiable information is REQUIRED) ..a quote may be considered non-responsive if a redacted copy of the technical quote is not received and therefore may be removed from further consideration for award.\n\nThe following shall be included as part of the quotes submission(See Technical Acceptability Above) :\nExperience of company and subcontractors anticipated to perform work under this contract\nManagerial & Technical Qualifications of key personnel\nQualifications of any proposed sub-contractors and the percentage of work they will be performing.\n-Past Performance.

This allows the Agency to streamline data management and meet quality standards listed in the Agency data management policy. This requirement is a follow-on purchase order contract to contract #75D30118P02651. The Government has invested considerable time and money on informing and working with the Vendor, and to use another Vendor for this work would require substantial time for a new Vendor to re-perform some of the work already performed under the previous contract. This would create significant delays for the Government, as well as increased costs for the Agency. The Vendor has a unique understanding of the data, needs and policies to effectively develop and implement a data management policy for the Government within the anticipated Period of Performance. The Vendor has written extensive code processing the Government's data. The Vendor is able to quickly transition from the previous contract to the anticipated contract. A new Contractor will require a transition period for information gathering and reading previous code, which delays progress and requires additional time and attention of Government staff. <strong>The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541519 Other Computer Related Services with a size standard of $27.5M.</strong> This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part FAR 13.106-1 (b) and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1).
