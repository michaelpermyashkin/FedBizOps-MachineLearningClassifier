Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-price factors. The quote with the lowest evaluated price will be evaluated for technical acceptability. Only if that quote is found to be technically unacceptable will the evaluation proceed to the quote with the next lowest evaluated price. This process will continue until the lowest priced technically acceptable quote is found. The following factors shall be used to evaluate technical acceptability of the lowest priced offeror: \r\n1.\tTECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH (non-price)\r\nThe Offeror must meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW). \r\n2.\tPAST PERFORMANCE (non-price)\r\nOfferors will be evaluated on their recent (within the past 3 years) performance of relevant requirements as described in the SOW.

An Offeror may also provide information on problems encountered on the identified projects and the offer’s corrective actions.
