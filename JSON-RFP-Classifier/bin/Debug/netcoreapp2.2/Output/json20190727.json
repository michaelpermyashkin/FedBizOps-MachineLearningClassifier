Smith (allen.smith3@va.gov)\n\n<a href=\"mailto:Allen.Smith3@va.gov\">Allen.Smith3@va.gov</a>","DESC":"Department of Veterans Affairs\nVeterans Health Administration\n\nNotice of Future Solicitation\nVHA Integrated Healthcare Transformation\n\nThe purpose of this Notice is to inform industry, including the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) community, that the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Procurement and Logistics, Strategic Acquisition Center- Frederick intends to soon release a solicitation for VHA Integrated Healthcare Transformation.\n \nBackground\nVA previously released several Requests for Information and conducted an Industry Day related to a future requirement for VHA Integrated Healthcare Transformation (IHT). Based upon industry feedback, stakeholder input and associated refinements to the requirement, VA now anticipates release of a solicitation in August 2019.\n\nPurpose\nThis requirement will support the needs of VHA program offices, specifically the Office of Healthcare Transformation (OHT) and its customers to best accomplish VHA s mission and strategic goals, priorities and initiatives. This work will be complex and agile and will be best supported through expert healthcare contractors providing critical market-based healthcare industry skills that augment the internal activities of the VHA program offices. This acquisition, referred to as Veteran Healthcare Administration Integrated Healthcare Transformation (VHA IHT), will provide a vehicle for a broad range of general management and business services and solutions in the broad health care environment.  The functional categories (FCs) will include: FC 1: Health System Transformation and Innovation, FC 2: Implementation and Operations Support and FC 3:  Specialized Health Systems Functions (previous  service groups  consolidated and categorized within these three primary categories).\n\nVHA IHT will provide best value healthcare and professional consulting services to VHA through a pool of highly qualified Veteran Integrated contractor Teams (VITs). The resulting acquisition vehicle is intended to be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This acquisition solution balances VA s obligation to provide to our Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) direct contracting opportunities and the VHA National Program need to obtain maximum value from healthcare related professional service expenditures. Opportunities for SDVOSBs are provided through set-aside IDIQ award(s) to Integrated Teams led by SDVOSBs serving as Veteran Integrated Team Agile Leads (VITAL), and SDVOSB teaming partners serving as VIT Eligible Partners (VITEPs). VHA National Programs will recognize maximum value from healthcare related professional service expenditures through integrated support crossing various Functional Categories, access to national healthcare consulting VIT Partners, and Team Partners with expert knowledge in any of the identified Functional Categories. Additional benefits include a vehicle that is focused on efficiency with streamlined ordering procedures and reduced procurement lead times.\n\nTask orders against this IDIQ contract will require contractor support for vast and complex healthcare programs and projects. VHA healthcare is a complex integrated system that must transform in response to both the changing needs of the Veteran population and changes in the healthcare industry. These shifts create challenges and require collaboration (internal and external partnerships) as well as new and innovative approaches to healthcare and healthcare delivery. The programs and projects will require diverse healthcare operations knowledge and experience.  Subject matter expertise could be required to be rapidly available to provide national support under a potential task order including, but not limited to, the following areas: high reliability organization, electronic health records management, healthcare modernization and transformation (to include integration of artificial intelligence solutions and disruptive models), financial management business transformation in a healthcare setting, healthcare human resources (to include credentialing, privileging and licensing), healthcare regulatory compliance, healthcare analytics, mental health and suicide prevention, access to care, and population health. All work will support various areas under VHAs business functional framework.\n\nRequirements of this PWS and future task orders will require highly complex healthcare experience. Highly complex healthcare requirements may include the involvement of multiple Functional Categories and several program offices and/or departments e.g. DOD and VHA.  Healthcare consists of the continuum of care and services that include but are not limited to: operations, management, and planning of diagnostic, preventative, remedial, therapeutic services in inpatient, outpatient, and telemedicine settings. Healthcare requirements may also include other activities such as management support of supply chain i.e. medical equipment, pharmacy services, healthcare claims processing and benefits administration. The scope of these requirements will also include the integration and management of various interrelated workstreams for a strategic, resource intensive, time constrained projects. \n\nNext Steps\nInterested firms (SVOSBs, other socio-economic categories and other than small businesses looking to play a role as VIT team members) are advised to monitor FBO for the solicitation, and to follow any included guidance/instructions included within the solicitation. This requirement will be a 100% SDVOSB set-aside, but fully mission capable VITs will likely require participation from the best firms within the gamut of socio-economic categories as well as leaders in private health care consulting.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nJoint Ventures\n\nVIP Verified SDBOSBs considering submission as prospective VITALs may do so independently or as part of a Joint Venture (JV). For the VITAL assessment of the advisory phase (Phase I), the Government anticipates considering work done individually by each partner to the JV, and previous work of the JV itself; however, given the tremendously important responsibilities assigned to the SDVOSB in contracts awarded to a JV, the relative experience of the SDVOSB partner to the JV may receive greater consideration/scrutiny given the significant predictive value in ensuring the experience of the SDVOSB integrating and managing large complex healthcare requirements is adequately considered. Limiting the amount of experience that may be credited to the non-SDVOSB partner (amount TBD) ensures meaningful consideration of the experience of the SDVOSB member of the JV.\n\nDuring the Advisory Phase (Phase I), prospective JVs may be provided a conditional advisement letter indicating viability as VITAL subject to CVE verification. To be eligible to serve in the VITAL role, the JV must be a separate legal entity verified as an SDVOSB, prior to the date established for receipt of Phase II proposals (formal team submission), and must have  carr(ied) out no more than three specific or limited-purpose business ventures for joint profit over a two year period.  If not already formed and verified, prospective JVs are therefore encouraged to start the JV verification process now to maximize the potential that CVE will have the opportunity to process the verification application in time. The Contracting Officer does not intend to intervene in the CVE verification process and cannot guarantee expedited processing of applications.\n\nSee the attached CVE Verification Assistance Brief Understanding Joint Venture and Mentor Protégé Eligibility for an overview and eligibility requirements. Questions regarding CVE process and additional details on verification eligibility should contact VA OSDBU/CVE.\n\nContract Teaming Arrangements\n\nContract Teaming Arrangements (CTAs) may be desirable from a Government and industry standpoint to enable companies involved to (1) complement each other s unique capabilities and (2) offer the Government the best combination of performance, cost, and delivery for the system or product being acquired. VITs will be fundamentally built upon formal CTAs.\n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) defines a CTA as  [A]n arrangement in which--(1) Two or more companies form a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential prime contractor; or (2) A potential prime contractor agrees with one or more other companies to have them act as its subcontractors under a specified Government contract or acquisition program.  For the IHT requirement, a joint venture CTA may be used to fill the VITAL role as described above. The second described CTA, prime contractor agreement with subcontractors, will be necessary to ensure robust, fully mission capable teams comprised of the prime (VITAL) and complementing VITEPs and VIT Subcontract-Only (VITSO) partners.\n\nUpon receipt of assessment results (Phase I), prospective VITALs will establish CTAs with those firms necessary to build the best possible team positioned to support any and all IHT task orders. Prospective VITALs should now be conducting the early dialog necessary to ensure CTAs in place prior to the date established for receipt of Phase II proposals (formal team submission).\n\n\nQuestions regarding this notice should be sent to:\n\nMr. William Milline (William.milline@va.gov)\nMr. Kevin Armillotti (Kevin.Armillotti@va.gov)\nMr. Allen Smith (allen.smith3@va.gov)","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/VA/AFMLOVASS/VASSMD/36C10X19R0036/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"Allen.Smith3@va.gov","DESC3":"Allen.Smith3@va.gov","SETASIDE":"Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business"},{"DATE":"0727","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Department of the Army","OFFICE":"Army Contracting Command, MICC","LOCATION":"MICC - Fort Belvoir","ZIP":"22060-5134","CLASSCOD":"J","NAICS":"561621","OFFADD":"9410 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir VA 22060-5134","SUBJECT":"ICIDS Maintenance","SOLNBR":"W91QV1-19-R-8337","RESPDATE":"073019","CONTACT":"Sharon C Lightfoot, Contract Specialist, Phone 7038052003, Email sharon.c.lightfoot.civ@mail.mil","DESC":"<p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS</p>\r\n<p>THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY.

Send to: anna.norcross@va.gov.\n\nGeneral Information\nThe National Military Sexual Trauma (MST) Support Team is seeking a contractor to lead the design of a 3-5-page booklet for providers intended to enhance provision of care to racial and ethnic minority MST survivors. Content for the booklet will primarily highlight Veteran quotations collected through a previously conducted qualitative interview project. Brief statements regarding clinical implications and action steps based on those quotations will also be included, provided by subject matter experts on the MST Support Team.\n\nScope of Work\nThe tentative title for the booklet is Understanding the Experiences of Racial and Ethnic Minority Survivors of Military Sexual Trauma: A Guide for Providers.  The main focus of the 3-5-page booklet will be on Veterans  experiences and the use of their own words (i.e., quotations derived from our existing pool) to highlight how providers can respond more competently and sensitively to MST survivors who identify as racial and/or ethnic minorities. Specific clinical implications and key action steps will also be included but kept brief so as not to detract from the quotations. The booklet will also provide basic information on 1) the impact of minority stress and both race- and ethnicity-based discrimination and harassment; and 2) the extent to which both race- and ethnicity-based discrimination and harassment can be a part of MST, and/or occur leading up to and/or following MST. Examples of key themes articulated in the Veterans  quotations include:\n\nculturally-sensitive ways for providers to communicate safety and build trust\nimportance of accurately documenting race and ethnicity in the medical record\nways to ask about race and ethnicity and their impact on MST and recovery\npatient-provider dynamics that can influence treatment engagement and success\nsociocultural and historical contexts that can contribute to symptoms, experiences of MST, and recovery\nways to demonstrate interest in and knowledge of different cultural backgrounds\nattention to the environment of care and its impact on survivors\n\nThe booklet must be 508 compliant and conform to all Department of Veterans Affairs, National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD) and MST Support Team standards with regard to technological specifications, design, and plain language. This product will be created as a pdf both for upload to our website and for print as a high-quality booklet. \n\nTasks - Planning\nWe require the production of a 3-5-page booklet that first and foremost highlights the Veteran quotations and their poignancy; it must also concisely share key recommendations and implications without overshadowing the quotations both in terms of layout and amount of content. We would like the tone to speak to providers in a warm and approachable manner. Development of the booklet will be guided by discussion between the contractor and MST Support Team subject matter experts, a review of the existing pool of Veteran quotations and the MST Support Team s list of suggested key themes and proposed outline of content, and a review of 2-3 key publications developed by the NCPTSD and/or MST Support Team, to be provided by the MST Support Team, that have a similar style, design quality, tone and feel to the end product booklet that the MST Support Team is envisioning.\n\nTasks   Production\nThe booklet design should be similar to the look and feel of the sample publications provided by the MST Support Team mentioned above. The MST Support Team will draft all written content, and thus will rely on the contractor for the design of the booklet and will not expect the contractor to draft written content.\n\nProject Management Plan: The contractor and MST Support Team will set a timeline and milestones for all aspects of the project, including \n\nfinalizing a draft of the written content following initial planning phase (MST Support Team)\nestablishing direction for the look and feel of the booklet (contractor)\noffering a minimum of 3 distinct design template options (contractor)\napproval of design template option (MST Support Team)\nchoosing images and icons and laying out the draft text in the chosen format (contractor)\nfinalizing the text/layout/images and making needed revisions (MST Support Team + contractor)\nensuring 508 compliance (contractor)\nproducing the final brochure (contractor)\n\nOnce the MST Support Team has finalized the draft text and the contractor has completed the steps outlined in task 4.1 above (e.g., reviewed MST Support Team s draft text, pool of Veteran quotations, and the 2-3 sample publications with a similar look and feel to the envisioned booklet), the contractor will provide an artist/designer who will be responsible for design and layout. Once a general direction for the look and feel has been established through conversations between the artist/designer and the MST Support team, the artist/designer will produce at least three different mockups of the design with draft content for the MST Support Team to review. Once a final design template/layout is approved of by the MST Support Team, we anticipate up to three rounds of substantive edits before arriving at a final design. Additional small content revisions may be necessary to arrive at a final product.\n\nThe MST Support Team will work with the contractor to submit the product to the VA 508 Office for certification. The contractor must make all changes deemed necessary by that office in order to achieve 508 compliance. The contractor should schedule at least 1 month for the review, revision, and resubmission process. The contractor will provide the MST Support team with a 508-compliant booklet in PDF and printable formats along with all source files, such as InDesign, used to create them.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/VA/PrVMAC650/PrVAMC650/36C24119Q0488/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"ANNA.NORCROSS@VA.GOV","DESC3":"CONTRACTING OFFICER","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"USA","POPZIP":"02130","POPADDRESS":"VA BOSTON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM;150 S.

This project requires that 684 mini-DV analogue tapes containing recordings of therapy sessions be converted into individual digital files. Each digital file must be named using a study-specific identification number.  Each tape will be its own file (one tape=one therapy session).\n\nOur specific needs for this project do not require the videos to be high resolution   there will be no editing. We are most interested in the files retaining high sound quality during the digitization process as they will be transcribed for audio content. If HQ-MP4 resolution is the most standard file format and retains good sound quality that is sufficient for this work.\nOnce digitized, all digital files will be transferred back to the NCPTSD investigators.  When receipt of digital files has been confirmed by VA Boston investigators, the mini-DV tapes will be destroyed.\n\nSince this is research, we will need a CSCA (Contractor Security Control Assessment) initiated by the Contracting Officer (per Privacy Officer) as Question 7 on the 6500.6 has been answered  yes .\n\nNCPTSD WILL PROVIDE\nThe study team will provide the vendor with the 852 mini-DV tapes that require digitization, using a secure delivery method that allows for package tracking (e.g., FedEx, UPS).  \n\nThe study team will label each tape with a unique identifier that must be captured in the digital file name assigned by the vendor. The format for the unique identifier will be  ParticipantID_tx condition_session number. \n\nREQUIRED FROM CONTRACTOR\nContractor must have sufficient data security capabilities to operate under the privacy conditions outlined in the Agreement throughout the duration of the period of performance. This includes storage of analogue tapes in a locked space that provides physical security\nContractor will digitize approximately 852 mini-DV tapes.\nEach individual digital file will be saved with file names that include the unique identifier used to label each mini-DV tape.  \nContractor will securely transfer digital files directly to NCPTSD investigators using encrypted media storage (e.g., encrypted DVD, encrypted thumb drive) using a secure delivery method that allows for package tracking (e.g., FedEx, UPS).\nUpon confirmation of successful receipt of digital files by NCPTSD investigators, vendor will destroy the 684 mini-DV tapes in a manner ensuring that data cannot be recovered.","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/VA/PrVMAC650/PrVAMC650/36C24119Q0489/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"ANNA.NORCROSS@VA.GOV","DESC3":"CONTRACTING OFFICER","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"USA","POPZIP":"02130","POPADDRESS":"VA BOSTON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM;150 S.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>\r\n<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>\r\n<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>\r\n<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).
