In light of this Program, the VA does not intend to move the Veterans or disrupt their care.\nA Justification and Approval (J&A) will be executed by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) for the new contract and will be posted to www.fbo.gov within 14 days of award as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.01(a)(1)(iii).","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/VA/VANCHCS/VANCHCS/36C26119Q1086/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","EMAIL":"","EMAIL2":"felicia.demita@va.gov","DESC3":"felicia.demita@va.gov","SETASIDE":"N/A"},{"DATE":"0818","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Department of Veterans Affairs","OFFICE":"Nashville VAMC","LOCATION":"Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center","ZIP":"37129","CLASSCOD":"66","NAICS":"334516","OFFADD":"Department of Veterans Affairs;Network Contracting Office 9;1639 Medical Center Parkway;Suite 400;Murfreesboro TN  37129","SUBJECT":"66--36C249-19-AP-2108   Base +4 - Infinity Analyzer and Reagents","SOLNBR":"36C24919Q0482","RESPDATE":"100119","ARCHDATE":"10162019","CONTACT":"Crystal Baird\nContract Specialist\n615-225-5427\ncrystal.baird@va.gov\n\n<a href=\"mailto:crystal.baird@va.gov\">crystal.baird@va.gov</a>","DESC":"Page 3 of 3\nRequest for Information-Sources Sought Notice \n36C24919Q0482\nThis is a Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research to determine the availability of vendors capable of providing an Infinity 48-32 with applicable reagents and service for the period of 12/1/2019 - 11/30/2020.

The Worm ships disassembled to save on shipping costs, but can be easily set up for use in a matter of minutes.Many hours go into the precision construction of each hand-sewn Worm—all of which are made at the Rogue manufacturing facility in Columbus, Ohio, using quality 1000D Kordura. The key to the design—and its challenge as a multi-athlete training tool—is the uneven distribution of weight. The Worm features a 12\" (30.5CM) diameter cylinder with an exterior shell and internal fillers of varying sizes. There are (2) 100LB filler bags, (2) 70LB filler bags, and three additional 6LB separator bags. Throw in the 7LB weight of the shell, and the 4-Person Worm comes in at 365LB total.The 4-Person version of the Rogue Worm made its debut at the CrossFit Regional team competition in 2018, and is adapted from the original 6-Person Worm that we first brought to the Games in 2014. This new compact model measures 11' in length (vs. the 17’ of the original), but is otherwise the same beast CrossFitters have come to love and hate., 3, EA;<BR><span class=\"label\">LI 002: </span>TheraGun G3\r\n•Handheld Vibration Therapy Device\r\n•Professional-grade plastic composite construction with industrial-grade Japanese motor\r\n•Weight: 2.7 LBS \r\n• Dimensions: 250mm x 200mm x 70mm \r\n•Amplitude: 16mm\r\n• Stall Force: 40 LBS \r\n• 2 Speeds: 29 and 40 percussions per second \r\n• Built-In Battery Life: 60 minutes \r\n•Color: Black\r\n\r\nMade In USA\r\nNo  \r\n\r\nColor\r\nBlack  \r\n\r\nProduct Weight\r\n2.7 LBS  \r\n\r\nLength\r\n250mm  \r\n\r\nWidth\r\n200mm  \r\n\r\nHeight\r\n70mm, 4, EA;<BR><span class=\"label\">LI 003: </span>Bandbell Strap-n-Hook and Anchor Loader Pair Kit\r\n product number ba0012\r\nBandbell Strap-n-Hook & Anchor Loader Kit Includes:\r\n\r\n(1) Strap-n-Hook Pair: This durable connector is designed to bridge the gap between the high-kinetic output of latex bands and low-kinetic set-ups that allow for better bar control at any weight. Takes away the need to add/change bands during a workout.\r\n\r\n(1) Anchor Loader Pair: Solid steel loading system that works with the Strap-n-Hook or conventional latex bands. Puts out plenty of kinetic energy while still helping to improve bar control via a perfect balance of weight and movement. 100 LB load capacity., 4, EA;<BR><span class=\"label\">LI 004: </span>Bandbell E-Maxx Bar\r\nDesigned around the principle of Oscillating Kinetic Energy (OKE), the handmade E-Maxx Bar (a.k.a. \"The SuperQuake\") has the same lightweight, wood/composite resin construction as BandBell's popular Bamboo and Earthquake Bars. The difference is a greater overall length (86.50” vs 80\") for more band loading capacity, which allows for heavier lifts and maximum kinetic energy.\r\n\r\nThe E-Maxx Bar can be custom-setup in a multitude of ways with both bands and weights. Two-inch grooves cut into the wood are designed to channel and grip the bands even as the bar bends radically under super-heavy weight. High-tech polymer bumpers have been added to each end of the bar to protect it when racking and to provide better control.\r\n\r\nUse the SuperQuake for heavy squats, bench press, deadlifts, etc. It's made to handle the big stuff. This design works perfectly for CrossFit, high-performance and functional athletes, powerlifters, bodybuilders, and general workout programs.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The Worm ships disassembled to save on shipping costs, but can be easily set up for use in a matter of minutes.Many hours go into the precision construction of each hand-sewn Worm—all of which are made at the Rogue manufacturing facility in Columbus, Ohio, using quality 1000D Kordura. The key to the design—and its challenge as a multi-athlete training tool—is the uneven distribution of weight. The Worm features a 12\" (30.5CM) diameter cylinder with an exterior shell and internal fillers of varying sizes. There are (2) 100LB filler bags, (2) 70LB filler bags, and three additional 6LB separator bags. Throw in the 7LB weight of the shell, and the 4-Person Worm comes in at 365LB total.The 4-Person version of the Rogue Worm made its debut at the CrossFit Regional team competition in 2018, and is adapted from the original 6-Person Worm that we first brought to the Games in 2014. This new compact model measures 11' in length (vs. the 17’ of the original), but is otherwise the same beast CrossFitters have come to love and hate., 3, EA;<BR><span class=\"label\">LI 002: </span>TheraGun G3\r\n•Handheld Vibration Therapy Device\r\n•Professional-grade plastic composite construction with industrial-grade Japanese motor\r\n•Weight: 2.7 LBS \r\n• Dimensions: 250mm x 200mm x 70mm \r\n•Amplitude: 16mm\r\n• Stall Force: 40 LBS \r\n• 2 Speeds: 29 and 40 percussions per second \r\n• Built-In Battery Life: 60 minutes \r\n•Color: Black\r\n\r\nMade In USA\r\nNo  \r\n\r\nColor\r\nBlack  \r\n\r\nProduct Weight\r\n2.7 LBS  \r\n\r\nLength\r\n250mm  \r\n\r\nWidth\r\n200mm  \r\n\r\nHeight\r\n70mm, 4, EA;<BR><span class=\"label\">LI 003: </span>Bandbell Strap-n-Hook and Anchor Loader Pair Kit\r\n product number ba0012\r\nBandbell Strap-n-Hook & Anchor Loader Kit Includes:\r\n\r\n(1) Strap-n-Hook Pair: This durable connector is designed to bridge the gap between the high-kinetic output of latex bands and low-kinetic set-ups that allow for better bar control at any weight. Takes away the need to add/change bands during a workout.\r\n\r\n(1) Anchor Loader Pair: Solid steel loading system that works with the Strap-n-Hook or conventional latex bands.

The difference is a greater overall length (86.50” vs 80\") for more band loading capacity, which allows for heavier lifts and maximum kinetic energy.\r\n\r\nThe E-Maxx Bar can be custom-setup in a multitude of ways with both bands and weights. Two-inch grooves cut into the wood are designed to channel and grip the bands even as the bar bends radically under super-heavy weight. High-tech polymer bumpers have been added to each end of the bar to protect it when racking and to provide better control.\r\n\r\nUse the SuperQuake for heavy squats, bench press, deadlifts, etc. It's made to handle the big stuff. This design works perfectly for CrossFit, high-performance and functional athletes, powerlifters, bodybuilders, and general workout programs. No matter how it's used, the bar trains the user to develop and hone perfect form.\r\n\r\nBandbell Strap-n-Hook & Anchor Loader Kit Includes:\r\n\r\n(1) Strap-n-Hook Pair: This durable connector is designed to bridge the gap between the high-kinetic output of latex bands and low-kinetic set-ups that allow for better bar control at any weight.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.
