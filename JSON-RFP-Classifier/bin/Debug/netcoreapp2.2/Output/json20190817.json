The unit will be used in the microbiology laboratory to enumerate bacteria in samples generated during research experiments. Bacterial enumeration using the spiral plater has been approved by the FDA. The spiral plater eliminates the need to prepare serial dilutions during enumeration of bacteria, thereby reducing time and labor required to process samples and providing cost savings by reducing the amount of dilution supplies required. Spiral plating also requires fewer plates than manual plating because different concentrations of samples are placed on each plate. The unit should have single keystroke touchscreen operation that loads the sample, inoculates the plate and cleans the stylus to optimize sample throughput speed. Additionally, also the unit should be able to take samples directly from beakers, bottles, or tubes then dispense samples onto the plates in volumes ranging from 10 &micro;l to 400 &micro;l. An automatic sanitizing system should be available to maintain correct liquid levels in sanitizing solutions. Exact quantities of sanitizing fluids should be dispensed automatically into sanitizer reservoirs to maintain optimum levels to provide fluid for over 900 wash cycles. The system should also have an illuminated, covered working area. The size of the unit should be approximately 420 mm X 465 mm X 298 mm to fit into available space in the laboratory.\r\n<p>The government anticipates award of a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the specifications will be most advantageous to the Government.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
