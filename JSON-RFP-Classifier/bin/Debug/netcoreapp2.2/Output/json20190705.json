Regular maintenance of the CryoPlatform is required since several major parts are subject to mechanical wear. Max. intervals are 10'000 operating hours or 2 years - whatever is earlier.</p>\r\n<p>The Natural Products Chemistry Section together with other members of the Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, NIDDK, carry out research that involves the discovery and development of small molecule and protein inhibitors that can prevent bacterial or viral infections. Chemical structure elucidation is critical to this research. This precise structural elucidation is done with sophisticated Nuclear magnetic instruments (NMRs) Each NMR spectrometer comprises a superconducting magnet, a console that controls the generation, application and detection of radiofrequency pulses, and a probe that detects the NMR signal and transmits this to the console. In contrast to superconducting magnets which last effectively forever, technological improvements both in console and probe design significantly enhance capabilities and permit one to design ever more complex experiments that were not previously feasible. Our current 500 MHz NMR console was purchased in 2005 and has aged out. We are seeking to upgrade as it is no longer serviceable, and hence in need of upgrading.  Further, the upgrades to the latest generation of consoles will increase attainable signal-to-noise by 20%, reduce spectrometer artefacts and facilitate high quality data acquisition in samples where the solvent is predominantly H2O (as opposed to D2O). (Note most NMR data are acquired in H2O to permit observation of exchange backbone and sidechain amide groups). The cryoplatform replacements for Bruker spectrometer 500 MHz is required as the current unit is over 15 years old and are no longer serviceable. The cryoplatform is an integral component of the cryoprobes that involve cooling to liquid helium temperatures, thereby reducing thermal noise and affording increases of 3-5 fold in signal-to-noise.  All our NMR spectrometers are being used to push the frontiers of NMR spectroscopy in structural biology, with considerable emphasis being placed on the application of these methods to AIDS related structural problems. These include work on HIV-1 Gag polyprotein, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, the fusion and cytoplasmic domains of HIV-1 gp41, HIV-1 integrase, HIV-1 protease, and various host proteins that are relevant to the pathogenesis of AIDS.</p>\r\n<p>The following specifications are required: The upgrade module must be able to be installed directly into the existing instrument, the Bruker Ascend NMR spectrometer 500 MHz NMR.

Original research performed in the Unit of Clinical and Translational Neuroscience, NIA Intramural Research Program (IRP) has identified several commonly used medications that may protect against AD. The purpose of the project is to perform data analysis to confirm whether these drugs protect against AD.</p>\r\n<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The main objective of the requirement is (but not limited) to:</p>\r\n<p>Perform data analyses on large electronic health record (EHR) and/or medical insurance claims data containing drug prescription information, demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes to test whether exposure to specific drugs (approximately 20 drugs to be disclosed by NIA IRP and referred to as &lsquo;NIA-AD drug list' hereafter) are associated with altered risk of incident AD and dementia. It is expected that approximately 10 drugs each will be tested in the base year and option year.<br />Technical requirements<br />1.\tThe primary datasets to be used for the analyses are to include: i) Medicare fee-for-service Part D claims data and/or ii) Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The contractor will provide evidence of exisiting access to the datasets including approvals required to use the data for the proposed analyses.<br />2.\tThe contractor shall provide evidence of prior work using the specific datasets indicated above in analyses similar to those described below.

This plan should include details about the validity of AD/dementia diagnoses, definitions of drug exposures (eg: in matched users and non-users) and outcomes including a detailed description of potential confounding variables. Details should be provided on how confounding by indication will be addressed by methods such as propensity score matching. <br />4.\tThe analytical plan should address how immortal time bias will be addressed by using methods such as time-varying exposures.<br />5.\tThe analytical plan should include a detailed description of the statistical methods that will be used to assess differential risk of AD/dementia between the exposed/user and non-exposed/non-user groups. It should describe how competing risks will be addressed by methods such as &lsquo;Fine and Gray' models. The use of robust variance estimators that account for clustering within matched sets must be addressed.<br />6.\tThe differential risk of incident AD/dementia between exposed exposed/user and non-exposed/non-user groups must be clearly summarized by appropriate metrics such as Kaplan-Meier plots.</p>\r\n<p>Period of Performance<br />One Base Year beginning on or about August 1, 2019 - July 31, 2019 with one additional one-year option period.</p>\r\n<p>CLOSING STATEMENT</p>\r\n<p>The solicitation will be issued on or about June 10, 2019, and bids or proposals will be tentatively due about 30 days after the solicitation release date.</p>\r\n<p>Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from the Jon Gottschalk electronically at jon.gottschalk@nih.gov and must reference the solicitation number 75N95019R00055, on your electronic request.

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>\r\n<p>Background:  The National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH), MEG core facility provides a vital service to the NIH IRP. MEG is a unique technique which allows the collection of high temporal resolution neurophysiology data which can be localized to specific regions of the brain. The current 275 CTF MEG system is state of the art in the field in terms of its sensitivity and ability to collect data from both deep subcortical structures and cortical surface structures. Crucial to the accurate localization of brain activity is an accurate co-registration of the MEG and MRI data.</p>\r\n<p>Purpose and Objectives: In order to provide an accurate co-registration of MRI and MEG recordings, the precise location of fiducial points must be labeled on MRI scans. While this is frequently done manually, manual placement is subjective and error-prone. Semi-automated methods using neuro-navigation systems utilize the research participant's MRI and camera systems to allow the user to mark the location of the fiducial points on the research subject and the MRI scan simultaneously. This results in more accurate and efficient co registration.</p>\r\n<p>Project requirements: The Contractor shall provide one (1) Brainsight Navigator System (Brand Name) or equal to the following specifications:</p>\r\n<p>Brainsight Navigator for TMS with computer and EMG. This includes neuronavigation software with 5 years of updates, the Northern Digital Polaris Vicra optical measurement system, power supply and cables, camera stand, complete tracker kit including pointer, coil tracker, subject tracker, calibration tool, subject head tracker band, subject tracker glasses, coil tracker fixation adapter, coil calibration jig. Also included is an apple iMac computer, input/output box, and mobile trolley to hold all equipment.<br />The system must utilize the research participants individual MRI and allow the designation of electrode and fiducial coil locations. In addition, the vendor should be chosen based upon what devices NIH investigators using the MEG Core Facility have experience using.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: Deliver 30 days after award</p>\r\n<p>Capability statement /information sought: Contractors that believe that they possess the ability to provide the required equipment, should submit documentation on their ability to meet each of the project requirements to the Contract Specialist.</p>\r\n<p>The Contractor should directly and specifically state in the, capabilities statement, which project requirements can be meet and/or supplied.

The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions. The Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation (DPI) at NCATS plans, conducts and uses both internal and contract resources to advance collaborative research projects across the pre-clinical phases of the translational science spectrum. To establish and move stem cell technologies forward through a more centralized effort, NCATS has launched the Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) within the DPI.</p>\r\n<p>The opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel non-addictive pain medications, as well as improved treatments for opioid addiction and overdose. There is a need for pharmacological agents directed at novel targets to test new therapeutic hypotheses, new clinic-ready drugs directed at those targets, and new testing systems with the potential to be more predictive of human clinical response than traditionally used models. Through the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative, NCATS will focus on the development of human cell-based models of opioid misuse and addiction and of pain. The SCTL is a state-of-the-art research facility dedicated to addressing the scientific and technological challenges in the iPSC field. Specifically, the SCTL aims to develop a renewable supply of human cell-based models focusing on new patient-derived iPSC lines that give rise to specialized, functional nerve cells that are relevant for opioid misuse and addiction, and pain.</p>\r\n<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this potential acquisition is to obtain a Bioluminescence System on a Brand-Name-or-Equal basis to the Olympus LV200 Biolucinescence System and accessories as described and identified herein produced by Olympus America, Inc., located at 48 Woerd Ave, Waltham, MA, 02453-3824, for the SCTL.</p>\r\n<p>The Olympus LV200 Bioluminescence System will allow SCTL scientists to image luminescent samples with superior brightness and high resolution and take full advantage of zero background, high signal to noise ratio and excellent detection sensitivity, offered by bioluminescence. This potential requirement will allow for real-time imaging of protein dynamics prior and throughout stem cells differentiation. In addition, this system will allow us to visualize the kinetics of cell surface receptors and their response to opioids and other small molecules that has been carefully designed for long-duration cell bioluminescence. A completely new optical design dramatically increases sensitivity and enables the detailed study of photosensitive cells and luminescence probes at high magnification.

All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>\r\n<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  541380-Testing Laboratories with associated small business size standard of 15 Million USD. <br /> <br />BACKGROUND<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions. The Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation (DPI) at NCATS plans, conducts and uses both internal and contract resources to advance collaborative research projects across the pre-clinical phases of the translational science spectrum. To establish and move stem cell technologies forward through a more centralized effort, NCATS has launched the Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) within the DPI.</p>\r\n<p>The opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel non-addictive pain medications, as well as improved treatments for opioid addiction and overdose. There is a need for pharmacological agents directed at novel targets to test new therapeutic hypotheses, new clinic-ready drugs directed at those targets, and new testing systems with the potential to be more predictive of human clinical response than traditionally used models. Through the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative, NCATS will focus on the development of human cell-based models of opioid misuse and addiction and of pain. The SCTL is a state-of-the-art research facility dedicated to addressing the scientific and technological challenges in the iPSC field. Specifically, the SCTL aims to develop a renewable supply of human cell-based models focusing on new patient-derived iPSC lines that give rise to specialized, functional nerve cells that are relevant for opioid misuse and addiction, and pain.</p>\r\n<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />This Small Business Sources Sought notice seeks to determine eligible sources capable of achieving the essential features of this potential requirement. The purpose of this potential requirement is to obtain results from conjugation services with biochemical analysis on existing, government-ownded, scientific instruments including the Helios and Hyperion manufactured by Fluidigm Corporation, located at 7000 Shoreline Court Ste 100, San Francisco, CA 94080. The services requested in this order will be utilized by the SCTL scientists to continue project milestones and study the expression of markers of interest on the single-cell level in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) and their differentiated progeny, such as nociceptor cells, neurons, astrocytes, glial cells, trophectodermal/trophoblast cells and early progenitors committed to ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal lineages.</p>\r\n<p>The Helios is a mass cytometer that enables simultaneous detection of approximately 40 markers on a single-cell level in a suspension. This is achieved by binding antibodies to the antigens of interest that are conjugated to rare Lanthanide metals not normally found in biological systems. The suspension of cells stained with these antibodies is then introduced into the Helios instrument where it is ionized in a hot plasma and the ions of the metals are detected using a mass spectrometry detector. The Hyperion is a module capable of ablating tissues stained with metal-conjugated antibodies using a laser and the resulting plumes are then introduced into Helios for detection of its ion composition. Spatial information is recorded as the laser ablates the tissue spot-by-spot and line-by-line which allows for spatial reconstruction of the expression of the markers. The resulting data are highly dimensional images. The subject potential requirement includes services for the conjugation of Lanthanide metals to antibodies. These cell types that will be used in this study are derived from hPSC using differentiation protocols uniquely developed by the SCTL, which will put the SCTL at the forefront of high-dimensional marker research in pluripotent stem cells on the protein level.<br /> <br />Project Requirements <br />This Small Business Sources Sought notice seeks responses from qualified sources that are capable of providing the following salient service requirements of this potential government requirement deemed as the essential features needing to be achieved. Specifically, Offerors to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall possess the capability to provide the following types of testing as essential requirements:</p>\r\n<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the Statement of Work below.</p>\r\n<p>The SCTL will purchase a total of 160 antibodies of their choice and will send them to Fluidigm. Fluidigm will then conjugate Lanthanide metals to these antibodies according to the design for each panel. A panel of antibodies is a collection of up to ~40 antibodies with each antibody carrying a different metal. This is important to ensure that each detected metal will only be associated with one antibody and hence a single marker of interest.</p>\r\n<p>SCTL will identify antibodies to send to the vendor based on their specific targets. This selection will be done in batches (up to 38 antibodies per batch). The factors that the SCTL will consider when determining the antibodies are: Target outcomes derived from ongoing experiments (genomic data obtained from bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing), and the Effects specific antibodies have on the improvement of differentiation protocols. The vendor shall be required to perform the analyses with the \"Maxpar Antibody Conjugation Service\" on all 160 antibodies to enable single-cell researchers to dissect intracellular networks, using stable isotopes not normally found in biological systems to label antibodies and detect and quantify up to around 40 different parameters per cell.</p>\r\n<p>The contractor shall be responsible for: receipt of antibodies, perform conjugation of Lanthanide metals to the antibodies, perform biochemical quality confirmation using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and shipping of the antibodies back to the SCTL. Lanthanide metals are conjugated to antibodies using polymers in accordacne with the following steps:<br />1.\tpreload the polymer with lanthanide<br />2.\tperform buffer exchange and partially reduce the antibody<br />3.\tpurify the lanthanide-loaded polymer<br />4.\tpurify the partially reduced antibody<br />5.\tretrieve the purified partially reduced antibody and lanthanide-loaded polymer<br />6.\tconjugate the antibody with lanthanide-loaded polymer<br />7.\twash the metal-conjugated antibody<br />8.\tdetermine yield<br />9.\trecover and store the metal-conjugated antibody</p>\r\n<p>Features and Benefits of this potential requirement shall include: <br />&bull; The ability to detect and quantify up to around 40 channels simultaneously in a single cell results in exponentially greater information.<br />&bull; Simultaneous phenotypic and functional assays lead to substantial improvement in the understanding of the heterogeneity of cell states.<br />&bull; Removing the limitations of spectral overlap of fluorescence and the dysfunction of fluorophores inside cells allows the targeting of more intracellular proteins at a time.<br />&bull; Barcoding enables multiplexed combinatorial multiparameter screens.<br />&bull; Achieving a high-resolution proteomic snapshot or profile on the single-cell level distinguishes that cell from all others, revealing the heterogeneity of the sample.</p>\r\n<p>Offerors submitting a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall possess the ability to achieve the salient government essential features identified in this notice and provide documented evidence to be able to fully achieve the characteristicis of the subject requirement described herein.</p>\r\n<p>GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES<br />The SCTL will be responsible for: making list of markers of interest; designing multiple panels of any number of and up to 37 antibodies, each to carry a different Lanthanide metal (this allows simultaneous detection without signal overlap); choosing suitable antibodies from vendors; purchasing the antibodies; sending a sufficient amount of each antibody (up to 200 &micro;g) to the contractor for conjugation sending the antibodies in batches according to the panel designs of choice.</p>\r\n<p>Period of Performance / Contract Type\t<br />The Period of Performance shall be for 12 months after effective date of contract award and contractor receipt of material to analyze. A Fixed-Price type of Purchase Order award not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold is anticipated for any contract resulting from this requirement. The anticipated award date is August 15, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>Delivery/Warranty/Reporting <br />Delivery of at least 40&micro;g of each resulting metal-conjugated antibody that will be analyzed shall be delivered to the Government. Offerors must indicate an estimated delivery time in full after receipt of an order and any other training or warranty considerations applicable. Inspection and acceptance will be performed at NCATS located at 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20852. After the conjugation procedure concludes, each antibody's yield and quality will be reported to the SCTL, to include the following parameters: 1) yield; 2) concentration; 3) buffer formulation; 4) atoms/antibody ration by ICP-MS. The results derived from the mass cytometry experiments will be a part of scientific publications and they will be made available to the public on the SCTL public-facing internet website.</p>\r\n<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS/INFORMATION SOUGHT <br />Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize itself with the requirements of this project.

Systems to be tested and certified are listed on attachment A of this document.  All tests and inspections shall be performed in accordance with the requirements as outlined by the national fire protection association (NFPA), state, VA, VACO, and in accordance with manufacturer instructions.\n\nDESCRIPTION:  Contractor shall provide all supervision, materials, transportation, and labor necessary to perform testing and inspection of fire suppression and protection systems at the WTVAHCS.   See attachment A for specific testing, control and interval standards for EC.02.03.05   VHA standard column only.\n\nDEFINITIONS/ACRONYMS:\n\nA. CO - Contracting Officer\nB. COR - Contracting Officer's Representative\nC. NFPA - National Fire Protection Association\nD.    FMEO   Factory Mutual Engineering Organization\nE. VA - Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center\nF. WTVAHCS   West Texas VA Health Care System\n\nCOMFORMANCE STANDARDS:\n\nA. Test and inspection-wet pipe fire protection systems (quarterly)\n\nTests and inspections shall be conducted in accordance with NFPA 25 standard for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of water-based fire protection systems. System testing provides reasonable assurance that the system is operating as intended. Thus, testing will provide a degree of reliance for the protection for life, and property, from a fire through the inspection, testing, and maintenance methods. All system components shall be tested in accordance with NFPA 25 chapter 2, to verify that they function properly. Identify and report any conditions that render the system ineffective during a fire situation. During the test, control valves will be opened, closed, and checked for corrosion and accuracy. Valve position indicating (tamper) switches will be tested and adjusted if necessary. A detailed report will be provided with the test & inspection results to the VA. They should be compared to previous reports (if any) for discrepancies. \n\nB. Test and inspection-dry pipe fire protection (quarterly)\n\nPer NFPA 25 standard for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of water-based fire protection system, section 9-4.4.2.2, each dry pipe valve is to be trip tested, and inspected on an annual basis. Dry pipe valves will be fully trip tested when warm weather is prominent to allow time for all water that has entered into the system or, condensation to drain to the system low points. All system components will be tested to verify that they function as intended. Tests of components require: valves to open, close, and verified that they are seating accordingly, then restored to normal working conditions, gauges are free from corrosion and are reading accurately, valve tamper switches will be tested or adjusted for proper working operation. Should the dry pipe system protect areas such as a freezer the system shall be tested in a manner that will not introduce moisture into the piping. Each priming water level will be checked for proper levels on a quarterly basis. High priming levels can affect the operation of the systems supervisory devices and will be verified each quarter for proper levels. Low pressure alarms, and automatic air pressure maintenance devices, if provided, will be tested to verify proper operation. All testing will be performed during normal work hours and days. Should a full trip test and flow of the dry systems not be acceptable at the time of testing, the VA has the option to have a  functional  trip test performed. A  functional  trip test allows the dry pipe valve to be tested and internally inspected without flowing water through the systems. The testing and inspections will be conducted in accordance with the latest and most current NFPA 25 standard.\n\nA detailed report will be provided to the VA indicating the condition of the system. The newly acquired test results should be compared to previous test results (if any) for verification of ant discrepancies in the water supply, valve operations, or any other changed conditions, defective items should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible.\n\nFor all class I and class II fire sprinkler systems, on an annual basis, alarm check valves shall be inspected internally, serviced, and tested to assure that they function properly. For systems that include backflow prevention assemblies per NFPA 25 section 9-6 backflow prevention assemblies, all existing alarm check valves are to be internally inspected and serviced at five (5) year intervals. Testing the system control valve for verification that the valve is closing and holding properly.  Should the valve hold against pressure, the systems will then be drained of all system water pressure.  After draining the system, an internal valve service and inspection will be performed. All working components such as the clapper hinge, hinge spring, clapper facing, and the seat ring will be visually inspected for signs of wear. Any deficiencies will be noted on the inspection report. Upon completion of the internal valve service and inspection the system will be placed back into normal working operation; then, NFPA 25 inspection will be performed.\n\nC. Test and inspection-private fire service mains (25% each quarter)\n\nTest and inspection shall be conducted in accordance to NFPA 25, chapter 4 standard for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of water-based fire protection systems, and NFPA 25 standard for the installation of private fire service mains and their appurtenances. The purpose is to ensure a degree of operation for private fire service mains, and that fire hydrants function as intended. A visual examination of the fire hydrants will be conducted. The examination consists of checking for leaks, corrosion, location and position of the hydrant outlets, and physical damage (if any). The test will be performed to determine the working or operable status of the existing fire hydrant. This procedure consists of physical operation, and lubrication of the fire hydrant. This provides verification that the hydrant is not obstructed and is operating as intended. The flow tests will be conducted by means of operating 100% of the on-site fire hydrants during a one (1) year time frame. Twenty-five (25) percent of all hydrants will be tested each quarter. One fire hydrant will be used for determining the static pressure, and the residual pressure. One downstream hydrant will be opened at full flow to determining the gallons per minute flowing. Each of the fire hydrant flow results should be compared to previous year s results (if any) to determine if there is any indication of deterioration in the water supply. A flow graph will be prepared and provided to the VA showing the results of the flow test and hydrant operation.\n\nD. Test and inspection-antifreeze loop fire protection systems (quarterly)\n\nTests and inspections shall be conducted in accordance with NFPA  25, standard for the inspection, testing and maintenance of water-based fire protection systems, NFPA13, chapter 3-5.2.1, standard for the installation of sprinkler systems, and factory mutual engineering organization (FMEO) #2-8n installation of sprinkler systems modified guide. Testing provides assurance that the system is freeze protected as intended. Testing will provide reliance for the protection for life and property from a fire through inspection, testing, and maintenance methods. All systems components shall be tested in accordance with NFPA 25 to verify that they function properly. The intent is to identify and report any conditions that render the system ineffective against freezing conditions. Tests will be made by drawing a sample of the solution from the antifreeze loop at the lowest point within the loop. Solution testing will be conducted on an annual basis. However, it is recommended that sample testing be conducted numerous times during the freezing season. If system modifications occur sample test is conducted, an additional test should be conducted to verify that appropriate freeze protection is achieved. A hydrometer or refract o meter shall be used to measure the specific gravity of the solution drawn from the system thus indicating the level of freeze protection. A detailed report will be provided to the VA. Indicating the test and inspection results that should be compared to previous reports (if any) for discrepancies.\n\nE. Test and inspection-fire pump (annual)\n\nThe testing and inspection of the fire pump shall be conducted in accordance with NFPA 25, chapter 5 fire pumps. The purpose of the inspection is to verify that the pump assembly appears to be in good operating condition and is free from physical damage. Also to assure that the unit will start automatically and manually, and that it will provide a continuous delivery of the fire protection system (s) required water supply. Per NFPA 25, the pump may be tested by means of discharging water or by use of an approved flow meter, which does not discharge any water. Should a flow meter be utilized during regular testing, NFPA recommends that every third (3) year the unit be tested via water discharge. Information will be recorded and provided of three (3) test points. Three (3) test points must be recorded in order to satisfy NFPA requirements. One with no flow, one at 100% of the pump rated flow capacity, and one at 150% of rated capacity. The flow rates (GPM), and pressures (psi) shall be recorded. If a variable speed motor drives the unit the revolutions per Minute (rpm) are also recorded. For electric motors the voltage and amperage draw shall be recorded at each test point. The results are compared to the rated capacities of the unit. Simulating a normal power failure with the unit delivering peak power output shall test the automatic power transfer switch. Circulation and/or discharge relief valves shall be checked with the pump churning (no flow), to visually verify that sufficient water is discharging through the valve. Alarm indicators shall be checked and the jockey pump shall be operated. System components within the fire pump room will be tested. Control valves will be opened, closed, and checked to ensure that they seat properly. Gauges will be checked for corrosion and accuracy. Valve position indicating (tamper) switches will be tested and adjusted if necessary. A written report will be provided to the VA. In addition to the report, the test points will be charted on a graph providing a performance  curve  for the unit. The curve should be compared to the unadjusted field acceptance test curve and to the most recent previous (if any) test curve. Deficiencies should be reported as soon as possible. A summary of fire pump inspection, testing, and maintenance is contained in NFPA 25, table 5-5.1.\n\nADDITIONAL SERVICES:  Additional services are defined as any work requested and authorized by WTVAHCS that is within the scope of this contract but is in addition to the contract requirements.

The proposed CWGS must meet or exceed the following parameters:\r\n<p>1) Environmental Protection in the temperature ranges of 40oF to -40oF Threshold (T), 40oF to -60oF or below Objective (O). <br />Rationale: Soldiers operate worldwide to include extreme cold environments. Soldier will need a hand wear system that will provide extreme cold protection for long durations.</p>\r\n<p>2) The CWGS shall provide flame resistance and not melt or drip when exposed to heat or flame at the next to skin level (O). <br />Rationale: Exposure to the elements, environment and physical injuring during all types of missions are a constant threat to the Soldier, especially hands. Gloves are the Soldier's first line of protection from the environment in a variety of conditions. Gloves provide temporary protection while conducting tasks requiring intricate manipulation, to protection in extreme elements where there is little to no activity. The ability to adjust protection is critical in order for the Soldier to stay operationally effective across the full spectrum of operations and environmental conditions.</p>\r\n<p>3) Hand Dexterity to allow the Soldier to write clearly, easily adjust or use radios and other equipment (optics) with small knobs or levers in temperatures 40oF to 14oF (T), 40oF to -20oF (O). Gloves must not restrict the ability to place the trigger finger cleanly inside the trigger guard at 40oF to -20oF (T), 40oF to -60oF or below (O) of individual issued or crew served weapon systems. <br />Rationale: Soldiers must be able to accomplish routine Soldier tasks while in their Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and uniform. During missions, Soldiers need to have the dexterity and the flexibility to change equipment settings, write, and adjust their night vision optics, and fire weapons quickly and easily. Stopping to remove gloves or exposing the hands to hazards or injury while attempting to adjust equipment can reduce survivability.<br />4) Capacitive Touch that is compatible with capacitive touchscreens or resistive screens in temperatures 40oF to 14oF (T), 40oF to -40oF (O). <br />Rationale: Soldiers use technologies including touchscreens such as with NETT Warrior, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below/Blue Force Tracker (FBCB2/BFT) Joint Capability Release (JCR) during military operations.</p>\r\n<p>5) Made of materials that contain no health hazards or Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Toxic Industrial Materials (TICs/TIMs) Threshold=Objective (T=O). <br />Rationale: The CWGS may be directly next to the Soldier's skin. It must not cause distraction to Soldiers resulting from irritation.</p>\r\n<p>6) Don &amp; Doff of any component of the CWGS in less than 8 seconds.<br />Rationale: Gloves must be able to removed and put on quickly, depending on the situation. Soldiers in combat situations can find themselves in a position of needing to remove gloves quickly in order to increase dexterity and tactility of the hands. Soldiers may also find removal of the gloves necessary moving from one event to another. <br />7) A camouflage pattern or solid color \"over-white\" capability to potentially replace the current Army over-white mitten shells (NSN 8415-01-481-3434).<br />Rationale: The CWGS must blend with and not stand out from the rest of the Soldier's personal protective equipment (PPE) and uniform.</p>\r\n<p>8) Back of the hand comfort fabric that is a flexible pile-like fabric, which remains soft in cold conditions and shall not generate electrical static charge when rubbed. The comfort fabric will not freeze with ice and readily shed frost when shaken, and will not ignite, melt or drip in proximity to open flame. The comfort fabric shall contribute to the insulation of the cold weather glove system to protect against cold conditions and be dimensionally stable to laundering.<br />Rationale: Soldiers currently utilize the extreme cold weather mitten exterior fabric to warm the sensitive cold skin on the face and wipe the nose as needed. Ice and snow build up will scratch the face or cause damage to the skin.</p>\r\n<p>9) System durability for a minimum of 270 (T), 365 (O) days of operational use, in the systems intended environments/conditions without weakening of inner and outer components or separation of any parts of the CWGS.<br />Rationale: Soldiers require a CWGS that maintains functionality in intended environments and conditions when needed. Soldiers should not be using the CWGS when specialty gloves, e.g., barbed wire gloves, electricians or welder's gloves are required. Soldiers need durable, reliable equipment for the hands in combat operations.</p>\r\n<p>10) Suspension &amp; adjustability feature at the wrist that is capable of being adjusted using the free hand wearing the other glove and the capability to secure the hand wear within close proximity to the hands after removal (T=O).<br />Rationale: Soldiers in extreme cold weather environments must have a way to tighten their hand wear around their wrist to prevent the hand wear from falling off. Soldiers have typically used a cord routed around their neck to suspend the hand wear when they removed to keep them in close vicinity of their hands for quick retrieval and to prevent gloves from getting lost.</p>\r\n<p>11) Constructed of quick-drying materials to allow for drying time within 4 hours (T), 1 hour (O) under standard lab conditions in a heated environment. <br />Rationale: Water absorption is an undesirable characteristic as it adds to the weight to the glove system during wear or tactical stowage and will cause extreme discomfort and negatively affect the Soldiers ability to perform duties. A heated 10-man Arctic Tent is commonly used to dry gloves during periods of rest and recovery.</p>\r\n<p>12) Provide a slip-free grip palm and fingers, while affording sensitivity during delicate tasks in the temperature range 40oF to 14oF (T), secure grip for tools and weapons during extreme weather conditions in the temperature range 14oF to -20oF (O). <br />Rationale: Soldiers need protection to conduct precise technical work such as operating electronic equipment or doing tasks requiring intricate manipulation requiring a sensitive touch, while at the same time protecting of their hands from the cold weather environment. In colder temperatures a glove with additional protection is needed that allows the Soldier to conduct tasks while conducting combat patrols in cold weather such as load, firing and reducing a stoppage of the individual or crew served weapon. Also, tasks such as shoveling, driving stakes into the ground, and erecting tents will be cold weather essential tasks.</p>\r\n<p>13) Compatible with all equipment and items issued to the Soldier as individual <br />equipment or PPE (T=O). <br />Rationale: Soldiers must have clothing and equipment that does not interfere with one another. This ensures each piece of Soldier equipment or clothing, current and future will be an integrated, component of the total system and allow the Soldier to tailor their clothing and personal equipment to the mission.</p>\r\n<p>14) Accommodate unisex hand sizes XX-Small, X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, X-Large and XX-Large. <br />Rationale: Soldiers require availability of all sizes to ensure proper form, fit, and function for all Soldiers who wear the CWGS.</p>\r\n<p>15) Resistance to water, wind, petroleum, oils, lubricants, and detergents at a level equal to existing cold weather gloves. <br />Rationale: Petroleum, oils, and lubricant products are a hazard present on the battlefield from transportation to weapon systems and exposure can result in Soldier illness, which directly reduces the unit mission readiness. The gloves must be able to minimize or avert skin expose while remaining durable. Liquid absorption is an undesirable characteristic as it adds to the weight to the gloves during wear or tactical stowage. Soldiers should not be using the CWGS when specialty gloves, e.g., fuel handler's gloves are required.</p>\r\n<p>16) Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate (MVTR) rate of greater than 7.0 grams/hour (T), greater than 10.0 grams/hour (O).<br />Rationale: Soldiers require cold-wet weather protective systems, which includes breathable gloves that enables moisture movement away from the body while preventing moisture from entering into the system. Moisture management contributes to warmth and comfort for the Soldier in adverse weather conditions.</p>\r\n<p>The Government anticipates this solicitation will result in the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Firm-Fixed-Price contracts.</p>\r\n<p>Proposals due 30 days after RFP release.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />(ii) The solicitation number is 70T05019Q9NNFB001. The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).<br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2019-03.<br />(iv) This acquisition is \"Unrestricted.\" The associated NAICS code is 713990 with a small business size standard of $7.5M.<br />(v) List of line item numbers and items, quantities, and units of measure:</p>\r\n<p>00001 Base Period Firing Range Services (August 1, 2019 - July 31, 2020) 104 Days<br />10001 Option Year 1 Firing Range Services (August 1, 2020 - July 31, 2021) 104 Days<br />20001 Option Year 2 Firing Range Services (August 1, 2021 - July 31, 2022) 104 Days<br />30001 Option Year 3 Firing Range Services (August 1, 2022 - July 31, 2023) 104 Days<br />40001 Option Year 4 Firing Range Services (August 1, 2023 - July 31, 2024) 104 Days<br />(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Use/rental of an existing/established firing range.

There are no addenda to the provision. <br /><br /><br />(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (OCT 2014) does not apply to the solicitation. The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:<br />Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary or in the government's best interests. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:<br />1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:</p>\r\n<p>a. Quotes that are not received timely<br />b. Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1(OCT 2018)<br />c. Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation<br />1) the most recent certification of lead exposure testing;<br />2) the most current OSHA compliance certificate/letter<br />3) air sample for lead with submission of quote.<br />d. Quotes that fail to complete HSAR 3052.209-70 (JUN 2006)<br />e. Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>\r\n<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.<br />3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.<br />If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue in order by price until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.<br />4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.<br />(a) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:<br />Factor 1. Technical Acceptability: Proposals must demonstrate full compliance with all SOW specified regulations by submitting: <br />(a) the most recent certification of lead exposure testing;<br />(b) the most current OSHA compliance certificate/letter; and <br />(c) air sample for lead with submission of quote and;<br />(d) Quote Submission checklist</p>\r\n<p>The failure to meet any one Requirement may be cause to determine that proposal non-compliant. A site visit may be conducted to verify range requirements are compliant.</p>\r\n<p>Factor 2. Past Performance<br />Past performance will be rated on an \"acceptable\" or \"unacceptable\" basis.</p>\r\n<p>Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, \"unknown\" shall be considered \"acceptable.\"</p>\r\n<p>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. CPARS) to evaluate past performance.</p>\r\n<p>Factor 3. Price<br />Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.<br />(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote. Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov. If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.<br />NOTE: If an award is granted and OSHA standards are not in accordance with regulation, the government has the unilateral right to terminate contract at any time via written notice by the Contracting Officer.</p>\r\n<p>52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998)<br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

In order to accomplish this mission, VASTLHCS  Facility Engineering Service (FES) intends to partner with an Architect/Engineer A/E or Engineer Firm for a design completion to conduct a Physical Security Assessment in accordance with VA's PSDM (Physical Security Design Manual) and additional supplemental guidance published by VA for VA owned and leased facilities at the VA Saint Louis Healthcare System.\nSCOPE OF WORK\nThe mission of the Veterans Affairs is to provide the highest quality health care to our nation s veterans. To accomplish this mission, we must protect the health and safety of patients, employees, and visitors.  The Leavenworth Kansas VA hospital is a high visible government facility located just minutes from the US Army Command and General Staff College Fort Leavenworth, KS.  This VA could be a high payoff target of opportunity for terrorist threats and actions against it.  It is essential that any passive and active protection gaps be identified and mitigated to ensure a safe environmental posture to all staff, veteran/patients and visitors be created and maintained against terrorist and other anti-governmental threats. \nAll VA facilities must follow the Mission Critical and Life Safety Physical Security Design Manuals (PSDM s) for security design guidelines within our network.  In addition, OCFM has published recent updated guidance on security requirements for leased facilities.  \nThe Veterans Health Administration (VHA) physical security design manuals are located at: \nMission Critical Facilities: https://www.cfm.va.gov/til/PhysicalSecurity/dmPhySecMC.pdf \nLife Safety Protected Facilities: \nhttps://www.cfm.va.gov/til/PhysicalSecurity/dmPhySecLS.pdf \nAlso, the summary of changes to the PSDM s in the Technical Information Library (TIL) dated January 2015 and all relevant appendices as well as the Security System Application Matrix below. \nhttp://www.cfm.va.gov/til/PhysicalSecurity/dmPhySecAppB.xlsx \nThe AE will further include all applicable Government and State codes, regulations and specifications as related work from the VA Master TIL.   Real Property Policy Memorandum 2018-02   Physical Security Standards for Leased Facilities. \nThe physical security of facilities requires the use of concentric levels of control and protection to provide progressively enhanced levels of security to deter, prevent, detect, delay, and respond to threats in the protection of assets.  The concept of concentric levels of control is to protect the central asset behind layers of security measures such that it is least exposed to the threats.  Where a single line of defense might be easily breached, the concentric levels approach offers redundancy in lines of defense that is less likely to be breached.   \nVA also follows the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design \n(CPTED, see www.cpted.net).  CPTED strategies include elements of natural surveillance, natural access control, and natural territorial reinforcement. CPTED strategies are to be considered by the AE in the development of recommendations tasked below to create and enhance the concentric circles or layers of security protection. \nThe SOW for this task order organizes the VA PSDM concepts for existing \ncampus/buildings into 3 tasks based on the  Point of Control  level and applicable PSDM concept chapters 3-10 for existing and leased buildings. \nGeneral Scope Tasks: \nTask 1   PSDM  Point of Control  levels 1 and 2: The first objective of the physical security assessment is to compare and develop a gap analysis of existing building and site conditions as they relate to the VA s PSDM s first and second level  points of control . These two points of control levels will survey for gaps which include but are not limited to identifying security issues as it relates to:\nLevel 1 pertains to the outermost level, should be at the perimeter of the property consisting of fences, barriers, both active and passive anti-ram rated vehicle arrest systems. The analysis will include the evaluation of both pedestrian and vehicle entry and exit points.\n\nLevel 2 analysis/survey will further include but not limited to accessing for compliance of: exterior and interior building and area access control hardware, intrusion detection, surveillance, and, at selected entrances at various times, personnel for control and screening. The assessment will provide a comprehensive analysis to include but not limited to PSDM: (para/section 4.1 PUBLIC ENTRANCES AND LOBBIES).\n\nTask 1 assessment will be made through document review and data gathering, owner interviews, and guided walkthrough non-invasive visual inspections addressing each of the applicable PSDM concepts. The document review will be based on VA provided Facilities Condition Assessments (FCA s), existing building data, past security assessments, any past security breach events, current Capital Plans (SCIP and Master Plans), existing as-built building drawings, site plans, and Google Earth building visual analyses. Interviews will be scheduled and coordinated with the COR and associated VA police/security staff to obtain compliance knowledge prior to visual inspections. The AE s visual inspection team will be accompanied by appropriate VA staff such as engineering and police. This task will apply to both owned and leased facilities identified in Attachment A & B.  \nTask 2   PSDM  Point of Control  levels 3-5:  \nThe second objective of the physical security assessment is to compare and develop a gap analysis of all existing buildings and campus entrance points and perimeter physical security conditions as they relate to the VA s PSDM s third through fifth  points of control .\nLevel 3 will include the assessment of area segregation with barriers and hardware generally accessible common/public and patient areas from staff-only areas.\nLevel 4 looks further into gap analysis of segregation of authorized from unauthorized staff areas with barriers and access controls such as card reader-activated hardware.\nLevel 5 includes the campus innermost level of physical security that controls access to restricted areas to a minimum with card-reader access controls, video assessment and surveillance system (VASS) monitors, intrusion detection alarms, and forced-entry and/or ballistic-resistant construction.\nThe assessment will provide a comprehensive analysis to include but not limited to PSDM: (para/section 8 UTILITIES & BUILDING SERVICES, para/section 9 BUILDING SYSTEMS and 10 SECURITY SYSTEMS). This security analysis will identify any gaps associated within the building structures, identify vulnerabilities of supporting utilities as well as standoff pedestrian and vehicle barriers, and security hardware. This assessment will be conducted through onsite surveys, document review, data gathering, and owner interviews.  To identify physical security gaps and ensure the PSDM intent is met; a physical and thorough survey and inspection is required.  The document review will be based on VA provided Facilities Condition Assessments (FCA s), existing building data, past security assessments, current Capital Plans (SCIP and Master Plans), existing as-built building drawings, Site Plans, and Google Earth building visual analyses. Interviews will be scheduled and coordinated with required VA staff to obtain compliance knowledge. If as part of the document review and interview process, its determined sufficient information does not exist to determine a gap with the PSDM concepts, the AE will flag the applicable PSDM concept for the need of a future assessment. This task will apply to  owned  buildings identified in Attachments A and B.  \nTask 3   Structural Analysis: To meet the physical security standards of the PSDM including but not limited to: (para/section 7 STRUCTURAL SYSTEM), the design team must include a certified physical security specialist as well as a licensed professional structural engineer who has specialized training in blast design and analysis. These specialists shall become part of the design team during the concept phase of any project. This manual assumes the use of qualified physical security and blast experts as required within the PSDM (para/section 1.5 Requirements for Physical Security Subject Matter Specialists) and other sections as applicable within the PSDM. There are sections of the VA PSDM requiring certain existing building or site components meet specified test levels, blast and or structural calculations. The VA is not requesting anti-ram testing, deflection calculations or testing, blast load calculations, or any other required structural system calculations. Where such items are specified in the VA PSDM, the risk assessments specified under Task 1 and Task 2 above will include any related VA provided information; and the limits of the non-invasive visual walkthrough specified under Task 1. Structural Analysis by a qualified structural engineer will be limited to providing high level input into the recommendations associated with Task 1 only which focuses on protection of the building exteriors from blast and vehicular ramming threats.   \nThe PSDM has been interpreted that Progressive Collapse review is not required for existing buildings. To address potential risk associated with the VA s PSDM Progressive Collapse requirements, analysis to be performed under Task 3 of this SOW will be limited to the development of a list of high risk owned and leased buildings based on a VA provided list of buildings that have not had a previous seismic study and that are more than one floor. The AE will develop a list of these buildings and develop recommendations in the summary report limited to those that would enhance building perimeter protection. This task will apply to buildings identified in Attachments A and B.  \nSpecific Scope Tasks:\n1.  Members of the A/E Analysis Team: The AE shall form a project team to work with the Leavenworth VA COR, representatives to create the VA/A-E Analysis Team, which shall include, at a minimum, Risk Analyst, Architect, Physical Security expert, and VA Planning and Engineering representatives.  The Plan shall include their titles, roles, and contact information.\n2.  Gap Analysis and Recommendations: In support of Task 1 and 2 above, AE shall record and identify gaps and vulnerabilities between existing conditions and the PSDM concepts. The AE shall establish corrective action recommendations to be taken when buildings are deemed to be at risk or non-compliant with current PSDM s.\n3.  Risk Analysis Summaries:  AE shall develop a Risk Analysis Summary integrating assessment findings that includes building numbers, risk elements related to the specified PSDM s concepts, and the corrective action recommendations to alleviate the risks for each building analyzed. The summaries shall also indicate whether the AE team judges the risk to be significant and briefly state the basis for that decision. The risk summaries and preferred corrective recommendations shall be organized into a spreadsheet report that can also be placed as a legend on the campus site diagrams.\n4.  Develop Rough Order of Magnitude Budget Estimates and Service Implications:  AE shall develop high level cost and budget estimates, on a rough order of magnitude, to implement the recommended corrective actions for each building and portray the implications of the recommendations in terms of costs and interruption of services.\n5.  Campus Site Diagram: The AE will develop a campus-based site diagram to identify out of compliance deficiencies.  The site diagram shall provide call-out symbols for each identified Task 1 and Task 2 deficiency placed at or near the location of the deficiency, crossed referenced to a summary legend placed on the diagram. The diagram should also include a graphical representation of non-compliant facility standoff distances to roads and parking. The diagram will color code mission critical and life safety buildings. To accommodate the data to be placed on the diagram, a standard 30X42 drawing size is acceptable.\n6.  Assessment Schedules:  AE shall review Scope of Work, and then develop a work plan/process (work breakout structure - WBS) as well as a schedule of facility and building survey/analyses to be submitted to the Contracting Officer (C.O.) and Contracting Officer Representative (COR) for approval prior to start of the assessments.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Extend the RFQ closing date to Monday, 8 July 2019 at 1400 EST. <br /><br /><strong>All other combined synopsis/solicitation terms and agreements remain unchanged. <br /></strong><br /><strong>Amendment 0006: </strong>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the closing date of the RFQ from 03 July 2019 to 05 July 2019 at 1400 EST. <br /><br /><strong>All other combined synopsis/solicitation terms and conditions remain unchanged. </strong><br /><br /><strong>Amendment 0005: </strong>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following question:<br /><br /><strong>Q: </strong>This is for the Qty 8 Storage Nodes:&nbsp;<br /><br />Two (2) Current Generation x86-64 compatible server class CPU(s) with 18+ cores @ 2.8GHz utilizing the Socket P (LGA 3647) interface and support Hyper-threading (HT) technology.<br /><br />Does the Government require 2x CPU's that added together total (18+ cores)? <br /><br />Or does&nbsp;the Government&nbsp;want 2x CPU's and each processor has at least 18 core or more (totalling 2x CPU's being 36+ cores)? <br /><br /><strong>A:</strong> Each CPU would require no less than 18 cores, with two physical processors installed totaling a minimum of 36 available cores (18 cores per CPU x2 physical CPU's). <br /><br /><strong>All other combined synopsis/solicitation terms and conditions remain unchanged. </strong><br /><br /><strong>Amendment 0004:</strong>&nbsp; The purpose of this amendment is to update the specification for the Switches, cabling/accessories minimum requirement.&nbsp;<br /><br />Attachment #1 has been updated to&nbsp;reflect the minimum requirement change for the Switches, cabling/accessories specification.&nbsp;<br /><br />The closing date of this&nbsp;combined synopsis/solicitation is hereby extended from 27 June 2019 to 03 July 2019 at 1400 EST.<br /><br /><strong>All other combined synopsis/solicitation terms and&nbsp;conditions remain unchanged.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Amendment 0003:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions: <br /><br /><strong>Q1: </strong>Do all 32 ports need to support 10GbE/25GbE/40GbE/100GbE or can it be a mix and match of the speeds? If this is the Navy do they require TAA?<br /><br /><strong>A1:</strong> The switch ports do not have to operate at those specific speeds simultaneously, in fact most will either be operating at 10GbE or 40GbE transfer rates respectively. Traditionally speaking, what determines the operating mode is the transceiver/media converter, EUD's (End User Device) network card, and physical interface (cabling) between the two. To be specific, the Government requires a switch that has the capability of operating at 40GbE on all ports and the slower 10GbE speed when using the appropriate media converters (most 40/50/100GbE ports can operate at slower speeds depending on the transceiver). <br /><br />These would require TAA before committing to a purchase; however, all the Government requires is support documentation that outlines the devices technical specifications. <br /><br /><strong>Q2:</strong> Is the Government going to be using any protocol other than Ethernet for this setup? All the servers and workstations mention the requirement of \"Converged Network Adapter\". Please provide further clarification to what do these adapters will require to support:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Infiniband and Ethernet OR<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. FCoE and Ethernet OR<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Just Ethernet<br /><br /><strong>A2: </strong>Ethernet only.<br /><br /><strong>Q3: </strong>We are going to be upgrading network adapter ports and switch ports from QSFP+ to QSFP28 to make them future ready. QSFP28 ports are backward compatible and can work with QSFP+ transceivers to support legacy network. Please confirm this is acceptable.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>A3:</strong> Yes, this is technically acceptable so long as the vendor provides supporting documentation, which demonstrates their claim of compatibility.<br /><br /><strong>Q4:</strong> Storage nodes require Quad Port 40 Gigabit QSFP+ Adapter. Can the Government accept 2x Dual Port Adapters?<br /><br /><strong>A4:</strong> Yes, the Government will accept dual port network adapters, so long as they are compatible with associated cabling/transceivers paired with to switch.<br /><br /><strong>Q5</strong>: Any RAID required for QTYx 3 1U servers for 4x 10TB DATA drives?<br /><br /><strong>A5:</strong> No, NUWC technicians will configure the storage layout without any assistance from the vendor.<br /><br /><strong>All other combined synopsis/solicitation terms and conditions remain unchanged. </strong><br /><br /><strong>Amendment 0002: </strong>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following question:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Q1:</strong> Any specific manufacture needed for the specifications mentioned like Dell / HP / IBM ? Please advise.&nbsp;\r\n<p><strong>A1:</strong> There is no brand name requirement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q2:</strong> Regarding the workstations, for requirement number one (1) graphic card, 4+GB DDR5. What is the number of Cuda Cores required and the (Peak Single Precision FP32 Performance) TFLOPS required?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>A2:</strong> The Government requires a graphics card with enough bandwidth to push two 4K displays simultaneously at a refresh rate of no less than 60 Hz.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span>While the intent is to use this device for the purpose of display rendering/visualization only, the device should contain a minimum of 1792 CUDA cores (or equivalent), 4 Gigabytes display buffer, and offer a peak compute capability, which exceeds two TFLOPS with SP FP32 datatypes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q3:</strong> Regarding the workstations, for number two (2) Graphic Card, 16+GB (HBM2), What is the number of Cuda Cores required and the (Peak Single Precision FP32 Performance) TFLOPS required?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>A3:</strong> The minimum number of CUDA cores for these<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span>graphics cards configuration is 5,120 and 640 Tensor cores with and expected peak performance level greater than or equal to 14 TFLOPS when working with SP FP32 based datatypes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q4:</strong> For the Network Interface Cards (NIC), it states Dual Port 10/40 QSFP+ Converged Network Adapter, and then it states that the NIC must support traditional 10GbE copper connections (Cat6a and Cat7 STP Cabling). What is the required interface for the NIC port? Will NUWC Newport use a (QSFP+ to RJ45 Transceiver module), and will that transceiver module be required to be included, or does the NUWC Newport already have these transceiver modules?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>A4:</strong> Correct, the Government's intent is to utilize transceivers at the switch, which convert QFSP+ connections to traditional Ethernet (eight transceiver's would be required in total).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q5:</strong> What is the Operating System Required? The OS is not listed, does that mean the NUWC Newport will provide their own OS and install on their own?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>A5:</strong> NUWC will provide, install, and configure an operating system on these devices.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span>However, we require that the systems motherboard and chipset be compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6+ operating system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q6:</strong> For the servers hard drive requirement of<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span>10TB, what is the required GB/s?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>A6:</strong> The Government requires that each drive is capable of supporting a max-sustained transfer rate OD of approximately 240+ MB/s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q7:</strong> For the storage hard drive requirement of<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </span>10TB, what is the required GB/s?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>A7:</strong> The Government requires that each drive is capable of supporting a max-sustained transfer rate OD of approximately 240+ MB/s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q8:</strong> What is the Operating System Required?

In addition, alignment stripes shall also be painted on hangar doors that, when fully retracted as designed, leave visible yellow/red stripes at the top of the doorway, yet still provide sufficient clearance for aircraft movement into/out of the hangar. With the hangar door fully retracted, the alignment stripes shall be painted in the upper corners of the doorway, on the door (exterior and interior), and on the adjacent track/bulkhead. The alignment stripes shall be readily visible from the deck, and should be approximately 6 inches (0.15m) long and 2 inches (0.05m) wide.\"<br />3..3.3 Per AVFAC Bulletin 1M: \"...where the approach line intersects a white forward superstructure or hangar face, two 12-inch black lines shall be painted on either side of the approach line, up the aft face of the superstructure from the flight deck to the top of the forward superstructure/hangar face. This will create an apparent 12-inch wide white extension of the approach line, up the white forward structure/hangar face for proper pilot alignment.\"<br />3.4 Lubrication.

NOTES<br />4.1 Base Access Requirements. Access to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) requires submittal of access forms. The FTC-OSPR-17 and OF306 forms are required for all U.S. citizens. The 17A form is an additional form that is required for all foreign nationals (including naturalized citizens). FLETC requires 10-14 days for processing of applications for U.S. Citizens and up to 30 days for foreign nationals. In general, new contractors are provided with an initial 30-day badge. These 30 days are intended to provide time for the contractor to get fingerprinted and allows the CG time to process fingerprints (which typically takes 2 weeks). It is only after FLETC receives positive fingerprint results that they will provide a \"full-badge\" (which should last the duration of the contract). If and only if, the contract will last 5 days or less, only a FTC-OSPR-17Z needs to be submitted for each contractor that will need access to the facility. Contractors that will be onsite for longer than 5 days will need to follow the process outlined above.<br />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PLEASE REVIEW ATTATCHED SCOPE OF WORK FOR FULL DETAIL</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />INTERESTED VENDORS PLEASE SEND OFFICIAL QUOTE, WITH A SAM.GOV REGISTERED DUNS NUMBER, AND EMAIL TO ANTHONY.J.ANDALUZ@USCG.MIL</p>","LINK":"","URL":"https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DHS/USCG/VPLMLCP/70Z08519QP45G8500/listing.html","DESC2":"Link To Document","SETASIDE":"N/A","POPCOUNTRY":"US","POPZIP":"29405","POPADDRESS":"CGC JAMES\r\n1050 REGISTER ST\r\nNORTH CHARLESTON, SC 29405 US\nNORTH CHARLESTON, SC"},{"DATE":"0705","YEAR":"19","AGENCY":"Department of the Army","OFFICE":"US Army Corps of Engineers","LOCATION":"USACE ITL, GSL, EL, CHL, Vicksburg","ZIP":"39180-6199","CLASSCOD":"59","NAICS":"334413","OFFADD":"3909 Halls Ferry Road VICKSBURG MS 39180-6199","SUBJECT":"Linear Sensor System (LSS) Laser Interrogator","SOLNBR":"W912HZ19Q7244","NTYPE":"COMBINE","RESPDATE":"071519","CONTACT":"Janalyn H.
