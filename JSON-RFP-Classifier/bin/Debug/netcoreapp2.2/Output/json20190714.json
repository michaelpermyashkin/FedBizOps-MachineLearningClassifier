PACES and RACER are used in support of military, civil works, hazardous and radioactive toxic waste (HTRW), and other projects worldwide. These software applications provide a standard suite of automated tools used for the preparation of planning and budgetary estimates for analysis on budget cost data during design, Independent Government Estimates (IGEs) during bid opening or negotiations, modification estimates during construction, and captures contract costs for historical purposes. CEHNC supports the Tri-Services (Army, Navy and Air Force), as well as the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Department of Energy, Defense Logistics Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency.<br /><br />5.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: The purpose of this acquisition is to develop cost engineering estimating models for building construction, environment remedial action cleanup, and site work construction. The models must be in the correct format required and be consistent in structure with other models developed for use with/by the current Parametric Cost Engineering System (PACES) and/or the Remedial Action Cost Engineering Requirements (RACER) software programs. The PACES and RACER applications are parametric software programs used by the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Environmental Protection Agency for the computation of budgetary construction cost estimates which are then the basis for budget requests submitted to congress for approval. PACES and RACER produce budgetary construction cost estimates for MILCON, FUDS, and environment cleanup projects using minimal information available at the time. <br /><br />With the import of these estimates into more detailed cost estimating systems, the federal agencies are capable of updating and providing more accuracy to the estimate as details become available. The type of tasks that are performed using PACES and RACER include: <br />&bull; Cost Estimating Services using Parametric Software<br />&bull; Specific Software Development relating to Model Creation <br />&bull; Development of Interfaces with Parametric Systems<br />&bull; Software/Model Development and Training <br />&bull; Telephone Hotline Support<br />&bull; Software Registration, &amp; Distribution</p>\r\n<p>6.0 SUBMITTAL INFORMATION: CEHNC is requesting sources that are interested and have the capability of providing parametric models for building, construction, remedial action cleanup, and site work construction with rights to use the existing/current technology/software.</p>\r\n<p>Submit capability statements and/or technical responses to this Special Notice not later than 12:00 pm CDT, 19 July 2019 to Tezra.J.Hamilton@usace.army.mil.
